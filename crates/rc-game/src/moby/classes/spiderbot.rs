//! camera), whose marker it draws ([`draw_marker`], `0x3c6eb8`; red `0x700000f0` / `0x500000f0` when refused). The
//! throw is refused outside play or with a scene asked for (`0x1a8f00` / `0x1a8f08`), with no landing, a bot out, a
//! landing surface of a kind (`0x388be0`: 0 / 0xd / 0xe, 1 / 3 / 0xb / 0xc), a landing less than 0.75 up, onto the

//! may go, no landing yet); **1** ○ pressed (`0x138324 & 0x18b050`, not kept away `0x18c0dc`): one bot (`0x2d77d0`),
//! else its class sound 0 — the landing lag `0x18a000` 0x78, the prompt lease taken (`0x32cc40(6, 0, 1)`), the use

//!
//! **The bot** (pvars: `+0x00` its velocity, `+0x10` / `+0x14` the stick ahead and across, `+0x18` its speed, `+0x20` a

//! 6, kept in its pvars here). Made (`0x3f99d8`) update and draw distance 0xff, its rows kept (`+0x34 | 0x100`) from
//! Ratchet's angles. Every tick its down (`0x1b4270`): the gravity's, or with the line from 0.375 above to 1 below
//! along its up row (flags 2) on surface 2 the surface's normal reversed; the prompt lease. Then by state:
//! * **0**: its scale 0.00025, its 30 s (0x708 ticks); **1** (flying): it grows by 0.01 a tick to 0.01811, moves by
//!   its velocity under the gravity 11 a second² and the line from its last place (flags 0) lands it on anything but
//!   Ratchet and the hand: there, still, the lease, Ratchet in state 0x1c, the bot's camera ([`camera_switch`]),
//!   sequence 1 (blend 10, its speed 0), **2**. Ratchet in 0x62, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x63, 0x17, 0x18, 0x81, 0x27 or a scene
//!   ends it: the camera let go (`0x457b48`), **7**, the hand told (`0x3c6e98`).
//! * **2**: class sound 2, **3** (steered): the stick ([`stick`], `0x3f9bd8`), the turn toward it in the camera's
//!   frame ([`turn`], `0x3fa790`), the walk ([`walk`], `0x3f9cd8`: its corners, the push out of walls, the hold on the
//!   surface), its footsteps by its animation frame ([`steps`], `0x3f9ad8`); its 30 s out or ○ pressed → **9** (10
//!   ticks); Ratchet out of state 0x1c or a scene: the camera let go, **9** (0 ticks).
//! * **4** (falling): moved under the gravity 22 a second², a 0.2 sphere (else the line) stops it ([`sweep`],
//!   `0x3865e8`: off a wall or a moby of class type 5 it bounces, 85% of the normal speed); landed on a surface of no
//!   kind and not 0xc it walks again (**2**), else **9** (10 ticks); flying faster than 0.4 a tick → **9** (10 ticks).
//! * **9**: the hand told, **5** (the fuse): its timer out, the big explosion (crate::moby::classes::explosion, the
//!   ground its height, along its first row), class sound 1, hidden (`+0x34 | 0x41`), **6** for 50 ticks with Ratchet in
//!   0x1c (else the camera let go and 0): the blast ([`blast`], `0x3faaa0`) its first 21 ticks, its reach growing 16 a
//!   second (at most 8); then **8**. **7**: its timer out, **8**: Ratchet out of 0x1c to 0, the bot's camera let go when
//!   current, gone.
//!
//! Each tick from state 2 on its blob shadow (0.6, crate::shadows).
//!
//! **The camera** (class 0x1b; activate `0x457a90` never, init `0x457470`, update `0x4575e8`, pre nothing: the L02 class
//! table `0x2a6e0c`): `0x457aa0` sets its record's `+0x20` to the bot and switches it in (`0x2db6b8`). Init: `+0x28` /
//! `+0x2c` (−2.5, 1), `+0x30` 2.5 back, `+0x34` 1 up, `+0x60` the bot's up row; 2.5 behind and 1 above the bot looking
//! along its first row. Update ([`camera_update`]): the up — the bot's up row on a magnetic surface, else the world's —
//! eased toward by an eighth of the angle in `+0x60` (`0x3260a0`); the look at a quarter above the bot (the rows from
//! the place before this tick's move); the place `+0x30` across and `+0x34` along `+0x60` from there, the way it is
//! now; pulled in by 16 spheres from 0.075 to 0.5 along the line ([`camera_pull`], `0x457858`, flags 0x10); a tenth of
//! the way there a tick. The let-go (`0x2db5f0`) marks the current camera releasing: the follow camera comes back (a
//! cut). Run here at the end of the bot's own update (the original runs it after the moby loop) where the collision
//! is at hand; crate::cameras shows it.
//!
//! **The ends** (`0x3fb028(on, n)`): a bot out goes to 5 (on: blows up) or 7 (not), the hand told, its timer `n` (−1:
//! 10). The arena master calls `(1, −1)` at a challenge's end, Ratchet's warp `0x2bd368` `(0, 0)`. The port's warp
//! (crate::hero::Hero::teleport) has no moby world: it counts the warps (crate::hero::Hero::warps) and the bot ends
//! itself `(0, 0)` first thing in its update when the count moved since it last looked — the same tick as the
//! original when the warp came before the bot in the moby loop, and in either case before its next state is run.
//!
//! **The screen** ([`draw_screen`], `0x3f9818`): from its state 0 to its state 8 the bot is the HUD's screen callback
//! (crate::hud::ScreenCallback): its clock in the counters' place. **The bolts** ([`pull_bolts`], `0x3fa9a8`): while
//! it is steered, every other frame the resting bolts within 5 fly to it (crate::moby::classes::bolt::attract_to), and
//! are counted where they reach it.
//!
//! **The blast's sphere** ([`draw_blast`], `0x3fac68` → `0x3facb0`, registered every tick): a lens of the frame
//! copied as it stands (crate::fx::FrameQuad) around the bot while the blast grows, its 98 wobbles (`0x2496d0`) made
//! in state 0 and turned by each draw; its mesh the overlay's (Aranos's `0x296760` / `0x296160`).
//!
//! **The upgraded glove** (rows 0x4e / 0x69 / 0x6a, crate::hero::items::UPGRADE_ROWS; L00's addresses): the hand
//! **0x0e7a** (`0x403ec8`) is the hand above but for the bot it throws, **0x0e79** (`0x401ab0`), and no class sound 1
//! at the throw; its marker (`0x4042b8`) and its screen (`0x4018f0`) are the same. The bot (`0x4010a0`) is the same
//! machine with its own words ([`Layout`]: its timer `+0x60`, its reach `+0x64`, the stick `+0x50` / `+0x54`, its
//! speed `+0x58`; the globals `0x1b2b70`..`0x1b2ba4`) and these differences: its flight grows it to 0.023, its line
//! (flags 0) keeps its velocity when it lands and the tick goes on; its blast grows 10 a second and hits every tick
//! of state 6 with flags 0x810000; its fuse plays the class sound before the explosion; while it walks (states 2 and
//! 3) its guns run (crate::moby::classes::spiderbot_plus, `0x401c08`), and its end frees their joint nodes. Its
//! sphere (`0x403540` with the tables `0x29f8a0` / `0x29f2a0`, wobbles `0x2545d0`) is the same code on the same
//! tables; the port shares the base bot's mesh and wobbles.
//!
//! Not ported: the sphere's copy is the frame at full size (the game's is 256×256 CT16) and its TEST 0x5380b Z writes (ATST GEQUAL 0x80 with the
//! copy's alpha) are left out (the effects write no Z here); the gravity frames and moving frames (`0x386d68` / `0x386e48`, `0x388638` /
//! `0x3886f0`, `0x326450`), the level-specific refusal under 462.43 (`0x1a8ff4`) and the landing on the lava level's
//! surface 3 (`0x1a79f8`); the camera's blend in (its record's blend kind 1, `0x2db6b8`: a cut here) and its `+0x28` /
//! `+0x2c` set to (−10.75, 4) while the bot blows up (nothing reads them); `0x189ff2`; PAL's screen scale on the
//! clock (`0x1b3e04`). The warp count also moves on the port's other placings (crate::hero::Hero::teleport stands in
//! for `0x2b9e68` too: the vendor's exit, the arrivals), where the original does not end the bot; none of them can
//! happen while Ratchet steers one. The quaternion turns (`0x2f3ba8` of an axis not made unit) are made unit here:
//! the original's rows are set to length where they are read.
