//! angles, a spin of 3..6° a tick about its row 1, 3 times its size (the upgraded 5), 15 ticks of smoke. **0**
//! (flying): it moves and falls 14.6 a second² (`0x37ec68`); while the smoke's ticks run, three grey puffs along the
//! step, smaller as they run out; the sweep ([`sweep`], `0x37edb8`: a 0.3 sphere (0.5), else the line; not Ratchet nor
//! the hand) bounces it off anything (0.45 of the normal speed kept; its fourth bounce stops on a floor). A surface of
//! kind 1 / 2 (`0x3813b0`) blows it up; else it takes the sweep's place and velocity and its spin. Then every moby
//! with mode 0x4000 within 0.4 (0.6) of it (`0x2e14b0`, flags 1, not Ratchet) takes the row's damage (flags
//! 0x830000 along its way, kind `0x0e64 << 16 | 0x0103`) and it blows up. Else a bounce spins it anew (3..6° a tick
//! about the up × its way across) with its class sound 1; on the fourth it sits at the sphere's centre and rolls: **1**
//! for 30 ticks, along the ground at 0.4·3° a tick (×1.6), its spin 3° a tick about that axis, both ×0.9 a tick, then
//! it blows up. Its blob shadow 0.4 across (×1.6) outside the gravity frames.
//!
//! **The burst** ([`burst`], `0x400a30`): its class sound 0, two blasts (crate::moby::blast, `0x3f8348(s, 20, .., 1,
//! 0xe, 10, 0xf, 10, 0x14, ..)`: s 0.7 then 1, the shake asked), then 17 bomblets (`gp+0x1bf4`) flung 4..9 a second
//! (12) a random way 50..90° up (40..75°) in a frame about the up (`0x37ecc0`), each the hand's (`+0xb8`).
//!
//! **The bomblet** (pvars: `+0x00` its velocity, `+0x10` its spin, `+0x20` (s16) its life, 240..360 ticks, `+0x22`
//! (s16) its arming, 70 + its index, `+0x24` the upgraded hand's, `+0x28` its moving frame; once its size (2)). **0**:
//! it moves, falls as the bomb and sweeps (a 0.125 sphere (0.25), 0.95 of the normal speed kept, always bouncing; not
//! Ratchet, the hand nor a bomb), taking the sweep's place and velocity and its spin. A bounce hops it: of the mobys
//! within 7 (flags 1, not Ratchet) the nearest drawn one of class type 5 with health left, not a crate — its way across
//! turned toward that one's aim point at its speed across (at least 1/15 a tick); its spin anew about the up × its way
//! across (3..6° a tick); its class sound 0. Its life out, or a bounce off a surface of kind 1 / 2, blows it up; else
//! armed (counted down to 0), a crate or a moby with health left and its health block's `+0x06` 0 within 2 (8) of it
//! (`0x2e14b0`, flags 1, not Ratchet) takes the row's `+0x64` (flags 0x830000, kind `0x0ece << 16 | 0x0103`; the first
//! only, `0x31d378`) and it blows up: its class sound 1, a blast (`0x3f8348(0.6 (2.4), 20, .., 0, 6, 5, 6, 8, 10, 0,
//! ..)`), gone. Its blob shadow 0.225 across (0.5).
//!
//! Its glow in the hand: none (`0x2a7ed8` has no case 0x25).
//!
//! **The upgraded hand** 0x0e9e (rows 0x4c, 0x61, 0x62, crate::hero::items::UPGRADE_ROWS; L00 `0x266780`, `0x2679e0`,
//! `0x267ac0`: damage 12 (24, 50), the bomblets' 6 (8, 15), 25 bombs (40, 60); the Mega rows' firing arm 0x8a moving and
//! crouched) runs the same update `0x3ff2e8`; its bomb and bomblets take the upgraded constants (the bracketed ones
//! above) by the hand's class (the bomb's `+0x2c`, the bomblet's `+0x24`).
//!
//! The weapon mod (`0x3f9f70(m, 0x4c upgraded / 0x25, the hand)`, crate::moby::weapon_mods): Acid on every moby the
//! bomb touched and on the moby a bomblet hit (not a crate).
//!
//! Not ported: the pad rumble (`0x2d6d60` / `0x2d6f38`); the lock cheat
//! (`0x18b270`); the gravity frames and the moving frames (`0x326448`'s other gravities, `0x380e08`, `0x37f538` /
//! `0x37f618` / `0x37f5f8`: the port's crate::gravity stands in for the up); the write-only word `0x1b2b64` (0x14 at the
//! start and at an empty press); the blasts' heat shimmer (crate::moby::blast). The sweep's flag `+0x50` (a moby of
//! class type 5 bounces) is left unset by both callers (the stack's leftovers): taken as 0. The bomb's fourth bounce
//! puts it at the sweep's sphere centre (`0x1bf1b0`), which a line hit leaves from an earlier query: the line's point
//! here.
