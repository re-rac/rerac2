//! The Chopper (item 0x16, crate::hero::items::ROWS; L00's record `0x263840`: attachment 6, stance 0, use sequence
//! 0x8f, 30 a second, 1.8 a second, damage 1, 35 blades, name 0x32e2): the hand moby **0x0879** (`0x3b7038`, called by
//! the item pass while it is the hand item) and the blade it throws **0x087a** (`0x41e080`, made by `0x41d7d0`).
//!
//! **The hand** (pvars: `+0x00` its trail slot, `+0x0c` the cooldown (seconds), `+0x10` the jump throw's wait, `+0x14`
//! the lock, `+0x18` the last search's pick, `+0x1c` (s16) the ticks it must stay picked, `+0x1e` (s16) the lock's

//! outside first person and the look stance's twin 0x1d `0x18c354` is set to 0x28, else counted down (a throw from

//! * from first person or the look stance (1 / 0x1d): the cooldown out, ○ held (`0x18b050`), in the hand past 0x16
//!   ticks, a blade left: the cooldown 1 / the row's rate;
//! * from the throw 0x83 (crate::hero::melee: ○ on the ground, `0x2c96d0`'s case 0x16), no blend running, its

//! * in a jump (group 4, not landed), the cooldown at 0, ○ held, past 0x16 ticks, a blade left: the use stance
//!   (`0x2af5e0`: the firing arm's layer, sequence 0x8f), the cooldown, **2** for 8 ticks; then the blade, back to 1.
//!
//! A blade: one ammo, the hand's class sound 2, the blade made (`0x41d7d0(hand, its place, from the look, the trail
//! slot, the lock, 1)`, [`spawn`]), the hand its owner (`+0xb8`).
//!
//! **The aim** (`0x3b7598`): the hold counts down; ready, outside first person, the arm not raised at a wall
//! (`0x18c30c`) and between holds, the search (crate::moby::aim, no crates) from 0.75 up Ratchet's up row along his
//! yaw and pitch, 30 far, 10° (17.5° on Oozla while the lock is a 0x0a8d / 0x0a8e) by 20°, 35° by 45° near him: the
//! same pick 4 ticks running becomes the lock, held 2 ticks; none clears it; in first person there is none. A lock
//! shows its green reticle (FX 0x26, `0xff0fff0f`) on its aim point, `|0.9 − d·0.0067·0.65|` large at the camera's
//! distance d.
//!
//! **The blade** (pvars: `+0x00` its velocity (a tick), `+0x10` (s16) its life (300), `+0x12` (s16) the homing's
//! ramp, `+0x14` its target, `+0x18` (s16) the ticks it flies free after a hit or a pass, `+0x1a` (s16) past its
//! target, `+0x1c` the next bounce's kind (1: the first), `+0x20` the homing's spring, `+0x28` its spin, `+0x2c` (s16)
//! the mobys it hit, `+0x30` its trail (−1 none), `+0x34` (s16) search again, `+0x36` (s16) homing on its home point,
//! `+0x38` its loop sound, `+0x3c` the hand's trail slot, `+0x40` its home point, `+0x50` the hand's class, `+0x54` the
//! trail's points, `+0x58` its tilt (−70° at first), `+0x60` the lightning's refresh, `+0x64` the glow's phase, `+0x68`
//! thrown from the hand (not a split), `+0x70` its place at the throw; from [`TRAIL`] its trail's points, from
//! [`BOLT`] the lightning's).
//!
//! Made ([`spawn`]): 0.3 up, 0.3 left and 0.5 ahead of the hand in Ratchet's frame (a wall on the way from his chest
//! pulls it a quarter of the way back), flying the row's speed along his yaw (the look: the camera's yaw and its pitch
//! + 7°, which the throw's yaw and pitch `0x18aa24` / `0x18aa28` keep) turned as he is (the look: the camera); a
//! moby of class type 5 (or a crate) within 1 is its target at once, the blade on its aim point; else the hand's lock
//! (a split: its own search, 30 far, 10° by 20°); with one it is turned left by up to 25° (all of it at 30 away),
//! without one it goes for a home point 64 ahead of Ratchet (the look: of the camera), turned left 25° unless thrown
//! from the look stance with Ratchet hidden. Its trail (25 a slot, [`Pool`]) when the next is free, with two
//! after-images (crate::moby::afterimage: alpha 0x30 two ticks back, 0x17 three); tilted −70°.
//!
//! Each tick ([`update_blade`]): its home point turned about Ratchet with the platform's turn (`0x189f7c`); its life
//! out → **1**; a search asked for (all round, 12 far, crates too) gives a new target; a live target (drawn, in the
//! target list, health left) is homed on ([`steer`], `0x41f3f0`) unless the free ticks run; without one the home point
//! while it is ahead. Then it moves, out of the world's 2..1021 box it is gone, and the step's line (flags 0x10; 0x12
//! and no damage while it flies free) hits a moby with the row's damage (flags 0x10000, its kind the class's): at the
//! point, ten sparks ([`sparks`], `0x41f668`), the class sound 2 (a moby of health: 3, or 4 for a health block's
//! `+0x09` other than 1); its target killed by it (health at most the damage) has it search again; the third moby
//! (the Mega Chopper's second) ends it. Off the first moby it turns 10..35° about its up row × its way; off a moby
//! again it is reflected off the moby's up row, off a wall off the face (then 0.2 out, and a search when it has no
//! target); after a moby it flies free 10 ticks. Passing its target (it behind) gives 10 free ticks. Its rows face its
//! way (up the up there), tilted toward the turn (`(−turn)·60°`, ±4° with none, 5% a tick) and spun 24° a tick; its
//! speed the row's, down to 0.25 a tick in a hard turn. Its trail's points shift (40 at most) with this tick's start
//! newest; every 4 ticks the lightning's seven points are drawn anew across it, between times mirrored through it.
//! Its glow word pulses (phase 12° a tick) between `0x0a0aff` and `0x7f7fff` (the Mega's: `0xff0a0a` / `0xff7f7f`,
//! a split's `0xff7fff`). The after-images follow; its loop sound 1 plays. **1**: the trail and the sound let go, a
//! smoke burst (`0x3210a8(0.5, 5)`), gone.
//!
//! **The draw** ([`draw`], `0x41f9a8` → `0x41fb48`): from 3 points the trail as a ribbon (FX 0xb, additive) 0.5
//! wide (a split's 0.25) across the blade's up row, `0x202080` at alpha 0x50 (the Mega's `0x802020` / a split's
//! `0x802080` at 0x7f) fading in over its first 20 ticks; the Mega's lightning through its seven points
//! (crate::fx::ribbon: FX 0x17 and 0xe three times as wide, `0xff5050` / `0xff1010` at a random 0.5..1 of 0x7f / 0x30).
//!
//! The weapon mod: Acid on the moby a blade hits (`0x3f9f70(m, 0x41 upgraded / 0x16, the hand)`, crate::moby::weapon_mods).
//! The Lock On mod's lock (`0x18b270`, crate::moby::lock_on) wins the hand's aim (`0x325f90`) and the blades' targets.
//!
//! The gravity frames (crate::gravity): the blade keeps a tracker (`+0x6c`, `0x37f538(blade, 0, 1, 1, 1)`) that turns
//! its velocity each tick (`0x37f618`) and is given back when it goes (`0x37f5f8`); its place and home point ride the
//! level's moving frame (`0x380e08`).
//!
//! Not ported: the velocity flattened along the up, the after-images' points' ride of the moving frame (`0x41eda0`), the
//! after-images' one-ghost setting (`0x1adb0c`: two here), the trail slot's other users (the Lava Gun's class
//! `0x41b198`: their eviction frees this slot's after-images, [`Pool::slot`]). 
//!
//! The Mega Chopper (row 0x41, its hand class 0x0af6 with the same update `0x3b7038`; crate::upgrades): [`level`] is
//! its row's level, the blade's damage and speed its row's.
