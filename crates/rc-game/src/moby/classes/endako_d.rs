//! Endako (level 3)'s classes, set D: the city's breakables and its robots (L03 addresses; the engine functions they
//! call are named by their L03 addresses with the L00 ones the port knows them by where they differ).
//!
//! **The breakables.** Each waits in state 1 for a hit with the flags 0x4010000 (`0x31f0f0`, L00 `0x31dce8`) while
//! `+0x68`[0] = 0 and breaks in state 2: its pieces thrown (`0x32cd30`, L00 `0x32b580`, crate::moby::shards::
//! throw_all, from the `$gp` tables below: every one's skip piece `$gp+0x2a90` / `+0x2ad0` / `+0x2b10` is −1, so the
//! moby is deleted rather than left showing it), its class sound 0.
//! * **0x0f37** ([`update_0f37`], `0x41b360`, 50 placed): a lamp: two lasting glows 20 × its scale along its up row
//!   (crate::particles::glow, `0x340ae0` = L00 `0x33f550`); its break gives the level's bolts (`0x327b28` = L00
//!   `0x327388`, crate::moby::bolts::level_drop, 3 up), a blast of size 0 (`0x403f10`) and the general explosion's 15
//!   embers (`0x3219e0` = L00 `0x320538`) at the lamp's head, and six debris chunks out of each of its four corners
//!   (`0x328028` = L00 `0x327648`, crate::moby::shards::throw_chunks).
//! * **0x0f3e** ([`update_0f3e`], `0x41bc30`, 49 placed): a hanging lamp with a glow 8 × its scale under it; its break
//!   leaves its stub (0x0f40, `0x3285c0` = L00 `0x327898`) and a blast of size 0.75, and the lamp, hidden, pours smoke
//!   for 30 ticks ([`crate::particles::staged_box`], `0x2edd68`: 40 puffs, then 3 a tick out of a box that drifts
//!   aside) before it is deleted.
//! * **0x0f38** ([`update_0f38`], `0x41b750`, 13 placed): a box between two beams; its break gives a blast of size
//!   0.75, two debris chunks at each side and 15 puffs of smoke a side ([`crate::particles::staged_box`]).
//!
//! The breakables' count (`$gp−0x440`, `0x1aebb0`): each one with `+0x68`[0] ≠ 0 takes one off at its set-up, and
//! each break takes one off; no code the port has (nor any absolute read in the overlay) reads it, so it is not kept.
//!
//! Not ported (the breakables): 0x0f38's two beams (class 0x13ba, made by `0x42cdd0` while `+0x68`[4] = 0: from
//! (±12, −10, 20) to (±12, −25, 20) in its frame, colour 0x50285050, widths 0.5 / 1.5, kind 5, `+0x68`[8] ≠ 0 its
//! flag; its update `0x42c920` has no function in Ghidra and it draws itself); 0x0f3e keeps its glow's handle at
//! `+0x68`[4], which nothing reads.
//!
//! **The robots** 0x093c / 0x0940 / 0x0964 / 0x0a59 ([`update_robot`], `0x3c31f8`; mode 0x20, on crate::moby::ai's
//! framework, the movement block at `+0x110`): Clank's helpers. Each sleeps in a cage, its child, until Clank breaks
//! it, then follows him through the network of floor polygons of **0x0f2d** ([`update_0f2d`], `0x41b0b0`: built at
//! its set-up from its list of paths, `0x32b318`, crate::path_network::build_list; the openings between its polygons
//! no walls for the fences afterwards).
//! * **Set-up** (`0x3c4828`, state 0): mirrored at random (mode 0x8000 by `randi(2)`); on the floor under it
//!   (`0x31e228`, kept at `+0x3a4`), 0.089 up (0x0940 also 0.2 back); its child made at its place (`0x312738` +
//!   `0x32be48`: drawn, draw distance 0x30, its light and ambient; 0x0964's is 0x0972, the others' the cage **0x0d75**
//!   ([`update_cage`], `0x4096c8`) with the pieces `$gp+0xed0` (0x3fff) over it, 0x093c's 1.2 times its class's
//!   size); its movement block (radius 0.39 for 0x0940, 0.42 for 0x093c / 0x0a59, 0.15 for 0x0964; height 0.3, steps
//!   0.5, slope 1.588, gravity 1/720, the turn before walking 30°, stop 1.5); sequence 0 at a random frame; 1 (sub 0).
//!   0x0940 closes the records holding the unseen floors 0x097a of its eight groups `+0x200` (`0x41b120`); 0x0a59
//!   plays sequence 6.
//! * **Every tick** (`0x3c4828`): its shadow's slab probed within 24 of the camera (range 0x16); a hit with flag 1
//!   (`0x31f0f0`), or 10 below its start with the floor within 10 under it, and no robot's blast in the last 45 ticks
//!   (`$gp+0xec8` / `+0xecc`, crate::game::GameState::robot_blast_frame): a blast at 0.5 above it (`0x403f10`: size
//!   0.25, sprites 5 / 5 / 5, 10 puffs, 0x14 streaks, its light), 0x0964 breaks (`0x327e78`: pieces 0..3), its
//!   velocity stopped, 4 (sub 1), and it is beamed back to its child (`0x3c6c70` → `0x2ed370`, crate::moby::classes::
//!   teleport::start); the hit record let go.
//! * Sub-state 1, its first tick: the walk (`0x32f550`: turn accel 0.2°, at most 6°; walk accel 6/3600, most 3/60),
//!   accel `+0x24` 0.0017, stop 1.5.
//! * **1**: asleep until its child is hooked (`0x32bf38`): the help for its kind once (0x0940: 0x9cf in slot 0x26,
//!   0x093c: 0x9d1 / 0x28, 0x0a59: 0xa08 / 0x5f, while their counts are 0; 0x0964: 0x9d2 / 0x29 while never shown);
//!   4 (sub 1).
//! * **4**, beside Clank: its first tick sequence 0 (blend 15), the idles' count 2, still; Clank pressing on it
//!   (`0x18a090` / `0x18a08c`) pushes it ([`push`], `0x3c5970`) and it backs off ([`back_off`], `0x3c5848`); farther
//!   than 3 across from him with a way through the network: 3, sequence 2. At a sequence's end: from its idle 1 back
//!   to 0, else one time in its idles' count the idle 1 (the count a step toward 10, `0x31ff78`).
//! * **3**, following: toward Clank through the network ([`move_to`], `0x3c57c0`) fanned out by its place among its
//!   group's robots on the way (`0x3c6ef8`, every 16th frame; `0x3c70c0`); no way, within 1.5, or stuck over 60 ticks
//!   within 3: 4, sequence 0.
//! * **7**, sent (L14 only: `0x3cab28`, [`send_to`], by the prison's lifts): toward its goal through the network
//!   for 60 ticks, then 4.
//! * **The tail** (`0x3c31f8`, `0x3c5a70`): in the air or on a moby, upright and held (`0x32e698`); its state's ticks
//!   counted; drawn, its glow `+0x78` pulses between its sub-state's colours (`0x3c5b80`, `$gp+0xee0..`); its fence
//!   path the record it is in (`0x41b218`).
//!
//! Not ported (the robots): Clank's commands (`0x18c304`, its D-pad orders 1..8: the hero side has none) and all
//! they lead to — the states 2, 5, 6 and 8..0x15 (going to and using the unseen floors 0x097a, the pieces 0x0e87 they
//! raise, 0x0b10 / 0x0f4d, `0x3c6348` / `0x3c6560` / `0x3c6730` / `0x3c68d8` / `0x3c6a90` and their helps 0x9d0 /
//! 0xa29 / 0xa0a), the command list `0x32c138` and timer `+0x364`, the sub-states 2..8's limits; the fall of state
//! 0x16 (nothing the port has sets it); the head's look at Clank and the joint aims (`0x3c61e0` / `0x3c6018`,
//! `0x325588`: crate::moby::ai's joint aims are not ported); the colour flash `0x321690`; the counts of robots near
//! Clank (`0x1b275c..0x1b2764`); the glow's group stamp and draw hook (`0x2e8310(0x3c5e08)`); `0x3c6c70`'s search for a
//! nearer 0x0972 of its groups to beam back to (`0x2e0558`); the push on a moving floor moby (`0x3234d0`); the light
//! `0x31bcac`. 0x0964's child is the cage 0x0972 ([`update_0972`]).
