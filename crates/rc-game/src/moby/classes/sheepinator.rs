//! The Sheepinator (item 0x10, crate::hero::items::ROWS; L00's record `0x263300`: attachment 0, stance 1, use sequence
//! 0x38 (the firing arm's 0x3e crouched, none moving), the use keeps the stance, icon 0xea77, name 0x3312 "Sheepinator",
//! description 0x2f29, no ammo, upgrade row 0x48 "Black Sheepinator" at 900 points; not in the vendor's stock): the hand
//! moby **0x0a5d** (`0x3c76e0`, called by the item pass while it is the hand item). Held ○ throws a twisting red beam
//! from the gun; an enemy it holds drains its health's worth of time (a meter at the screen's right edge,
//! crate::hud::SideMeter) and turns into a sheep (crate::moby::classes::sheep, [`transform`]).
//!
//! **The hand** (pvars: `+0x00` the muzzle (joint 0, `0x3127c8`), `+0x10` the target, `+0x14` its most health, `+0x18`
//! the drain left, `+0x1c` (s16) a 15-tick use timer, `+0x1e` (s16) the use under way, `+0x44` the lock's ticks, `+0x48`
//! / `+0x4c` the aim's yaw and pitch, `+0x50` the meter's blink phase; the globals `0x1b2984` the point light,
//! `0x1b2988` its ticks, `0x1b298c` the loop sound, [`Mem`]). Its first tick (`+0x20` 0 → 1) clears the globals. Each
//! tick the use timer runs down; in the look stance 0x1d the look wait (`0x18c354`) counts down (else it is 0x28).
//!
//! **Firing** — standing or moving (`0x18c0bc` < 2), ○ held (`0x138320 & 0x18b050`) and the look wait out:
//! * its sequence 2 (blend 0) unless it plays it; the use stance (`0x2af5e0`) unless in use; the use timer 15 when out;
//!   the muzzle read; the look stance 1 goes to its twin 0x1d;
//! * the aim: in 0x1d with Ratchet hidden (first person) the view's forward, the arm raised at a wall (`0x18c30c`) the
//!   gun's −row 1, else Ratchet's forward row (`0x18a550`); its yaw and pitch (`0x2ef510`);
//! * the target ([`target`], `0x3c6fd0`); the lock's ticks down; a target deleted (state −2 / −3) is dropped;
//! * none found and no lock: the meter full (1); else a new target (not the one held, no lock) is taken — its most
//!   health (`+0x04`), the drain its health (`+0x00`; 0 when the most is 1 or less), the lock 30 ticks — and the drain
//!   runs down 10 a second (35 on a row of a Mega upgrade at level 2, the challenge mode's row 0x6d), not below 0;
//!   the meter is what is left of the most;
//! * the meter (`0x2fc520(f, 1, colour, 0)`): its colour blinks between `0x60ffffff` and `0x40ffc0a0` by the sine of
//!   its phase, which turns 360°..1440° a second as `f` runs from 1 to 0 (`0x327240`, `0x31e8d8`);
//! * the drain out on a target: on level 0xc a class-0xfb4 target counts (`$gp+0x1de0`) and the 16th gives skill
//!   point 0x16 (`0x1a7a7e`, crate::skill_points); its class sound 3; the transform ([`transform`], `0x404c18`); the
//!   sheep count (`$gp+0xf6c`) up; the target dropped;
//! * the beam ([`beam`], `0x3c7fe0`); the point light (`0x2fda20(7.5, 0, its place, 0x207f7f)` when it has none: radius
//!   7.5, 0.99 red and green, 0.25 blue) 0.5 along the gun's −row 1 from the muzzle, its ticks 20; the loop sound
//!   (class sound 1, mode 4) kept playing.
//!
//! **Not firing**: the target dropped, the use and the lock cleared, the beam to be laid out again (`0x1b2980`); the light
//! fades (its colour `0.05·t` red and green, a quarter of it blue, at the muzzle's last place) and goes as its 20 ticks
//! run out; the loop sound stopped; its sequence run out, back to 1 (blend 1); the use over (`0x2af848`). Put away
//! (`0x18b064` = 3) the light goes.
//!
//! **The beam** ([`beam`], `0x3c7fe0`; laid out again on its first tick, `0x3c7ed0`: twelve points from the muzzle along
//! the gun's −row 0, 8/12 apart, the scrolls and pulses cleared): its wave turns 11.5° a tick. Its reach: to the target,
//! its distance across Ratchet's up; else 8 along the aim to what the line (flags 0x14, Ratchet left out) meets, the
//! sheep let through (their collision off for the walk, `+0x98`; at most 6 steps and 128 sheep); its point spacing the
//! reach / 12. Its eleven points after the muzzle each follow the last: the way they lay blended toward the aim (the
//! gun's −row 1, from the seventh on bent 0.2 toward the target) by `0.9 − 0.5·i/12`, a spacing long (each first riding the
//! level's moving frame, `0x380e08`, crate::gravity::ride); round each a ring of 20 points 0.05..1.234 out (across the way and Ratchet's down
//! `0x18a0e0`), and two side points `±` a wave 0.01..0.5 out, turned 22.9° a point. Then sparks at the side ends
//! (twinkles at random, `0x33a6a0`: red `0x7f10107f` and `0x7f104fff` with white), at random a swirl at the muzzle
//! (type 0x4e, crate::particles::swirl: along the beam turned up to 15° each way, its life the reach · 6 (× 3 on a
//! target), one of five reds `0x7f307fff` .. `0x7f2020ff` and a white one following the target), and the pulses: every
//! 45 ticks a new one (three at most, 60 ticks) runs from the muzzle along the points at 8 a second, growing 0.1 → 1.5,
//! its alpha 64 falling over its last 30 ticks; past the end it flies straight on.
//!
//! **Its draw** ([`draw`], `0x3c8e40`, additive): the side strips (`0x3c9238`) — white FX 0xe ribbons 0.05 wide
//! scrolling 0.3 a tick, and FX 0x10 streaks 0.4 wide stretched 0.9 past each point (`0x103fff` on one side, `0x10107f`
//! on the other) — both fading at the ends; the pulses (`0x3c9828`, FX 8, `0x7f` red at their alpha, squares across
//! their way); the muzzle's glow (`0x3c9a50`, FX 0xb: 0.4 of `0x7f207f7f` and 0.1 white, 0.5 along the gun's −row 1);
//! the tube (FX 0xd, `0x400000ff`, two layers scrolling apart, its far end clear) between the rings 1..11, the faces
//! turned away left out.
//!
//! Its glow in the hand (`0x2a7ed8`'s case 0x10): crate::hero::items.
//!
//! **The Black Sheepinator** (rows 0x48 and 0x6e, the hand **0x0ead**, `0x406cf8`; [`BLACK_CLASS`]) runs this machine
//! with: its muzzle (0.15, −1, 0.06) through the hand's rows from its place (not joint 0); its targeting `0x4066b8`
//! ([`target`]'s plain line: no walk through the sheep — the line may meet only the target); its drain 12.5 a second
//! (50 on a Mega row at level 3) × 1.33 with item 0x48's row past its base (`0x139568[0x48]`'s level byte); its meter
//! black (`0x60000000`, no blink); its beam `0x407640` this one's code over its own globals (`0x2549f0..`,
//! `$gp+0x1de8..`, the same values) but the swirls' colours (blues `0x7fff5f20` .. `0x7fff1010`); its draw `0x4084a0`
//! this one's with the second strip `0x7f1010`, the tube `0x40ff0000` and the glow `0x60ff0000` (read where this one's
//! has its literal); its transform `0x409cf0`, the black sheep (crate::moby::classes::black_sheep).
//!
//! Not ported: the weapon's use statistics (`0x18c420..0x18c428`), the gravity frames' branches (the targeting's
//! `0x1a8ff0` / `0x18a168` / `0x1a8ff4` walls-and-ceilings test), `0x37c948(0x47, 0x5360b)` after the
