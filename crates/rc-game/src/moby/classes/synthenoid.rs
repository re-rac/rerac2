//! The Synthenoids (item 0x1f, crate::hero::items::ROWS; L00's record `0x264020`: class 0xcb2, icon 0xea6d, name
//! 0x32ef, shots 60 a second, 2 a second, damage 0.75, 24 shots each, 12 of them): not held. Asked for (the quick
//! select, the Weapons page: `0x3227d8(0x1f)`), the item change (`0x2b13c8`, crate::hero::items) sends them out
//! instead of taking them in the hand — `0x3ee110(Ratchet + 1.5 up, 0xcb2)` — and Ratchet keeps his weapon.
//!
//! **The deploy** ([`deploy`], `0x3ee110`): four tries of `0x3eca90` ([`make`]): a free one of the four slots
//! (`$gp+0x1758`: none, another class's or a deleted moby), one ammo taken (`0x2d42d0(0x1f, 1)`), a drone **0x0cb2**
//! made at the place: Ratchet its owner (`+0x34`), drawn, far 0xff / 0x7f, his light words (`+0x38`), his rows,
//! angles 0, mode 0x100, a tenth of its scale, its slot (`+0x38`), its shots (`+0x40`: the row's `+0x48`, 24). None
//! made: the class's sound 0 at Ratchet (`0x3603c8`).
//!
//! **The drone** ([`update`], `0x3ed5c0`; pvars: `+0x00` its place in the formation, `+0x10` its velocity, `+0x20`
//! its leaving's ticks, `+0x24` (u8) the muzzle's toggle, `+0x25` (u8) the shots fired, `+0x26` (u8) the ticks stuck,
//! `+0x27` (u8) its loop sound (the port keeps the handle at `+0x70`), `+0x28` its target, `+0x2c` 5400 (no reader),
//! `+0x30` its turn's speed, `+0x34` its owner, `+0x38` its slot, `+0x3c` the cooldown (seconds), `+0x40` its shots,
//! `+0x46` (s16) hidden by a scene, `+0x48` / `+0x4c` its sway's phases, `+0x50` / `+0x54` its bob and phase, `+0x60`
//! Ratchet's place last tick; the timer byte `+0xbc` its move's state). Outside play (`0x1a8f00` ≠ 0) it hides (mode
//! 0x41, `+0x46` = 1) and does nothing; back in play it shows. Its scale eases a tenth a tick to its class's.
//! * **0**: the formation point and velocity cleared, its sequence 0 (blend 10) unless already, far 0xff / 0xff, no
//!   shots, Ratchet's place kept, its loop sound (class sound 1, looped), the phases random, → **1**.
//! * **1**: its sequence run out, its sequence 1 (blend 10); its loop sound kept playing. Ratchet more than 20 from
//!   where he was last tick (not in the state 0x81) — on level 7 riding the moby 0x11d9 it moves with him instead —
//!   it goes at once (its slot freed). With shots left, Ratchet not in the groups 0x16 / 0x14 and in his own body:
//!   its place in the formation ([`formation`], `0x3ecc40`) and the move ([`steer`], `0x3ed0e8`); else its velocity
//!   cleared, 30 ticks, its class sound 2, → **2**. Then its shot ([`fire`], `0x3ecd68`).
//! * **2** (leaving): the loop sound stops; the ticks out, it goes (its slot freed); else a twinkle in a random colour
//!   0.3 about it (`0x33a6a0`: 0.5..3, 20..40 ticks, falling 0.00125), mode 0x200, its alpha down 0x80 / 30 a tick, its
//!   yaw spun 24° a tick.
//!
//! Past state 0: it rides Ratchet's platform (in his state 0x27 by his whole move `0x189f40`; else toward its place
//! plus the platform's step `0x189f70`, by the cosine share of 0.2 and then 0.625 of what is left), its blob shadow
//! (0.3, with the gravity frames off), and while drawn its exhaust from joint 0 (`0x3ed4f8`: three puffs, `0x33d400`,
//! sinking 1..2 a second). Its rows are Ratchet's (in his group 0xf: left as forward, back as left) turned by its yaw,
//! pitch and roll about its own up, left and forward.
//!
//! **The formation** (`0x3ecc40`): at `a` = slot · 60°, Ratchet's place + his left · 1.2 cos a + his up · (1.2 sin a +
//! 2.2) + his forward · 2 sin a: an arc over his head. **The move** (`0x3ed0e8`, by `+0xbc`): 0 turns toward the
//! point ([`face`], `0x3edfb8`: 0.1°, 0.05°, 11° a tick) and goes to 2; 2 turns toward its target (or the point;
//! 1220″, 90″, 1220′ a tick), and steers: its velocity takes 0.13 (0.25 within 1.3 of Ratchet across) of
//! `0.04 · (point − place) − velocity`, the height's 0.9 of that; leaving at most 0.045 a tick; the move against the
//! world (crate::moby::slide, `0x31c618(1, 0.5, 0)`); stopped (under 0.005) over 20 ticks and not drawn, it jumps to
//! the point; within 1.1 of Ratchet across it is pushed out by a tenth of the overlap; another value goes to 0 (2 when
//! farther than 1.3). Then its bob (0.1 · sin of a phase 0.03 a tick, along its up) and sway (`0x3244e8(0.25, 0.025,
//! 0.00625)`).
//!
//! **The shot** (`0x3ecd68`): the cooldown out, on its frame (`0x1b1948 % 4` = its slot): from its joint 1, the
//! search (crate::moby::aim, 20 far, 90° all ways, along the camera's forward row) — not 0x0ee1 / 0x0ec0 / 0x0ed4
//! whose `+0x3b1` is −1, not 0x0ef4 — gives the target (none clears it); its sequence 2 (blend 5); fired once that
//! sequence is in (not in a scene) and the drone more than 1.1 above Ratchet along its up: two sprites at the muzzle
//! (3 ticks, `0x202080` / `0x601080`), the shot ([`spawn`], `0x3ee200`) from 0.3 of the way to the target's aim point
//! (its health block's height, else 0.3 up), its class sound 0, a shot counted, the cooldown 1 / the row's rate +
//! 0..0.17.
//!
//! **The shot 0x0cbb** ([`update_shot`], `0x3ee618`; pvars: `+0x04..+0x0c` its wobble's phases, `+0x1c` its target,
//! `+0x20` its velocity, `+0x2c` its speed, `+0x30` its texture's scroll, `+0x38` its life (20) and `+0x3c` one over
//! it, `+0x44..+0x4c` its spin a tick). Made: far 0xff, drawn, mode 0x100, the drone its owner (`+0xb8`), six times
//! its class's scale, its speed the row's / 60, its angles random, its spin 0..4° / 8° / 16° a tick; along the
//! drone's forward (Ratchet's arm raised at a wall: the drone's −left; a target: toward its aim point); from the look
//! stance's twin with Ratchet hidden, from below the camera toward what its view meets 20 out. A target's health block
//! gets `+0x1e` | 0x80. Each tick: it homes on a live target (gone, or dead and not a crate: dropped); it moves, spins
//! and wobbles (its rows at 0.35 ± 0.15 of their length, 0.5 rad a tick, `0x3ef580`); its line (flags 0, Ratchet left
//! out) hits a moby with the row's damage (flags 0x10000, its kind the class's) — sparks and smoke at the point
//! ([`burst`], `0x3ef018`) — or, its life out, it fizzles ([`fizzle`], `0x3ef360`): either way it hides, its target
//! dropped, 6 more ticks of its draw (→ 1). Flying it leaves two glows (2 ticks), five smoke sprites along its step
//! (15 ticks) and every tenth frame a long glow (30 ticks). Out of the world's 2..1021 box it goes.
//!
//! **Its draw** ([`draw`], `0x3eecd0`): a streak 0.1 wide back along its way 2 (FX 0x17, `0x40108080` → `0x40101080`)
//! and 2 more fading out (to `0x801010`), its texture scrolling 0.1 a tick; over it one 0.6 wide and 4 long (FX 0xe
//! additive, `0x40ff0020` fading out).
//!
//! **The upgraded Synthenoids** (rows 0x3d / 0x5d / 0x5e, crate::hero::items::UPGRADE_ROWS; L00 `0x265a60`,
//! `0x267660`, `0x267740`: 80 a second, 3 / 4 / 4 a second, damage 0.5 / 4 / 8, their bomb's 5 / 25 / 50 (`+0x64`), 72
//! shots each): the drone **0x0b02** (`0x3d5e70`, made by `0x3d5230` into its own four slots `$gp+0x1270`) runs the
//! drone's machine above with its own copies of the helpers (`0x3d5400`, `0x3d5998`, `0x3d67a8`, `0x3d5da8`: the same
//! constants), but: its blob shadow whatever the gravity frames; no ammo at the make plays its class sound 6 at Ratchet;
//! state 0 clears `+0x46`; its shot (`0x3d5528`) is, while it has its one bomb (`+0x44`), one time in 10 a bomb instead
//! (crate::moby::classes::synthenoid_bomb, its class sound 3). The deploy sends out 0x0b02 with the row upgraded, and a
//! base drone in the field (not leaving) swaps itself for one at its place and leaves (`0x3ed5c0`).
//!
//! The weapon mod: Shock on a moby a shot hits with its collision on (`0x4126b8(m, 0x3d upgraded / 0x1f, the drone)`,
//! crate::moby::weapon_mods).
//!
//! The level's moving frame (`$gp−0x14e4`, crate::gravity): the drones ride it (`0x380e08`, instead of Ratchet's
//! platform), a shot takes its start's move on it (`0x380e58`) and rides it after each step (`0x380e08`).
//!
//! Not ported: the unreachable branch of state 1 (its
//! leaving's ticks past 20 there: a random sequence-1 blend and speed).
