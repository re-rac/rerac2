//! Endako (level 3)'s remote cranes (L03 addresses; the engine functions they call are named by their L03 addresses):
//! the terminal **0x0949** ([`update_0949`], `0x3c8030`, two placed), the crane **0x094a** ([`update_094a`],
//! `0x3c88b0`, two), the boxes it carries **0x0b85 / 0x0cfc / 0x094c** ([`update_box`], `0x3c9430`: Ghidra has no
//! function there, read from its bytes; 0x094c is not placed) and the wall the bomb box breaks **0x10f6**
//! ([`update_10f6`], `0x422a78`, also without a function). The crane's load may be a laser sentry 0x0ffd too
//! (crate::moby::classes::endako_c: its carry and drop, and the terminal's arming of one).
//!
//! **The terminal 0x0949** (its pvars: `[0]` the crane (a moby index; −1: deleted), `[1..3]` the cuboids of its three
//! views, `[4..6]` the cuboids the crane is seen from them in, `[7]` a sentry it arms, `[8]` the moby it then hooks,
//! `[0xc]` the view in use (−1 none)):
//! * **0**: no collision, not drawn, hidden (mode | 1); the view none; 1.
//! * **1 / 2** (2 once hooked, by the Electrolyzer puzzle crate::moby::classes::electrolyzer): with Ratchet on the
//!   ground within 6 of it across and in front of it (0 to 4 ahead, within 2.5 to the side) the prompt (owner 8):
//!   0x1310 while it waits, 0x12fa once hooked; △ on its prompt (`0x32bf48(8)`: the lease his, health left, not
//!   dying) puts Ratchet 2 ahead of it facing it in state 0x31 (`0x2bf080(…, 0x31, 1)`), the crane his (`0x18b650`,
//!   [`Globals::steered`]), the script camera on at its view (snapped, crate::script_camera, `0x43a7b8`), the crane
//!   steered ([`steer_on`], `0x3c9048`); 3.
//! * **3**: Ratchet kept from harm (`0x189ffc` = 5); the view followed ([`view`], `0x3c8458` → `0x43a6f0` /
//!   `0x43a748`) and, with a sentry `[7]` it arms (crate::moby::classes::endako_c::arm, `0x420768`) and `[8]`, `[8]`
//!   hooked. △ again: the camera released behind Ratchet (`0x43a928(0)`), he stands where he is (state 0), the crane let
//!   go ([`steer_off`], `0x3c9090`); 2.
//! * **The view** (`0x3c8458`): the view `[0xc]` kept while the crane is in its cuboid `[4 + view]`, else the first other
//!   whose cuboid holds it; the camera at that view's cuboid `[1 + view]`, looking at the crane's place at its start
//!   height (`+0xf8`): its yaw toward it, its pitch toward it raised 20° (`$gp+0x1114` = −20).
//!
//! **The crane 0x094a** (its pvars: `[0]` the path it is kept 1.25 inside (`0x344c08`, crate::moby::ai::fence), the
//! arm's three manipulators `+0x20` / `+0x60` / `+0xa0` (joint lists 0..2, crate::moby::Moby::joint_moves), its
//! velocity `+0xe0`, its load `+0xf0`, the rail's height `+0xf4`, its start height `+0xf8`, the hook's drop `+0xfc`
//! and its speed `+0x100`, the rest after a drop `+0x104`, let go `+0x106`, its looped sound `+0x108`, the drop's sound
//! said `+0x10c`):
//! * **0**: its own matrix (mode | 4); the rail: the line from 1 up to 20 up (none: deleted), `+0xf4` its height;
//!   `+0xf8` its height now; 1.
//! * **1 / 2** (2 steered): steered, ○ ✕ □ (`0x138324 & 0xe0`): with a load it is dropped with the crane's velocity
//!   (the boxes [`box_drop`] `0x3c9c68`, the sentry `0x420720`), the rest 30; without, rested and the hook up (the
//!   drop at least −1.5), the hook goes down (3). Let go (`+0x106`), 1. Its height eases to 6.5 under the rail
//!   (`0x320958`: 1/360 a tick², at most 1/6 a tick), the hook back up (`0x320220`: 1/360, at most 1/3), [`steer`].
//! * **3**: the hook falls (40/3600 a tick², its sound 1 once), [`steer`]; a sphere of 1 at the hook (`0x2e0558`)
//!   meeting nothing, down to −8: on. A bomb box 0x0cfc (resting: state under 2) or a box 0x0b85 with the hook at most
//!   2.7 above its place is taken, a sentry with it at most 2 above (hooked, `0x32bf18`), the drop raised to that
//!   height; met higher, on; else (the world, another moby) the hook comes back up; with a load 4, else 2.
//! * **4**: the crane slides over the load (the hook's height eased to 2.2 above a box, 2 above a sentry, 1/180 a tick²,
//!   at most 1/6; its speed eased to the distance across, then its velocity toward it at most that; kept in its path);
//!   within 0.01: 2, its sound 2, the load hung on the hook (the boxes [`box_attach`] `0x3c9c00`, the sentry
//!   `0x4206e0`).
//! * **Each tick**: the load without collision for the crane's queries and its collision back after; the arm's three
//!   joints moved down by the drop, each at most its own reach (−1.4, −2.7, −8: `$gp+0x1198..`), its matrix built
//!   (`0x315188`) and its sphere four times as big.
//! * **The steer** ([`steer`], `0x3c90c8`): steered, the stick (`0x18bdd0`, its x reversed) turned to the view's yaw
//!   + 90° gives the velocity it wants (6 a second, 3 with a box 0x0b85, 5 with another load); its looped sound 0
//!   while the stick is pushed and Ratchet steers (0x31). Not steered: its loop stopped, it wants to stop. Its velocity
//!   eases toward that across (12 a second², 3 with a box 0x0b85, 10 with another load), it moves by it, kept 1.25
//!   inside its path; the rail's height again (the line from 0.5 to 20 above the hook, flags 2); its shadow
//!   (direction 2).
//!
//! **The boxes 0x0b85 / 0x0cfc / 0x094c** (their pvars: `[0x60]` the path they are kept in, `[0x64]` the cuboid a box
//! 0x0b85 belongs in, its home `+0x70`, velocity `+0x80`, the offset under the hook `+0x90`, the crane `+0xa0`, the
//! ground's height `+0xa8`, the offset's speed `+0xac`, landed `+0xb0`, its glow `+0xb4`, the fuse `+0xb8`, the wait to
//! come back `+0xba`, the shake's timer `+0xbc`):
//! * **0**: home here; a box 0x0b85 whose uid is done starts in its cuboid; 1.
//! * **1**: every eighth frame, more than 0.05 above the ground (the line from 0.5 up, flags 2): it falls (3). A bomb
//!   0x0cfc: a hit with the flags 0x10001 lights its fuse (4: 1 tick from a box 0x0b85, else 10), as does Ratchet
//!   touching it (his push, ground, wall or ledge moby). The others, landed and Ratchet not steering: in their cuboid,
//!   put at its place and the uid counted; else kept 2.5 inside their path.
//! * **2** (hung): its offset under the hook (2.3 down) shrinks by a speed eased toward its length (1/3600 a tick², at
//!   most 1/60); at the hook plus the offset.
//! * **3** (falling): 1/120 a tick² down, kept 1.25 inside its path; at the ground: a bomb on a surface of kind 1 goes
//!   off (5), else its fuse (4); the others 1; the crane's sound 3, the shake in 2 ticks. Each tick the hits under it
//!   ([`box_hits`], `0x3c9ca0`: a sphere of 1.25 at its place (100, flags 0x10000) and the four lines round its base).
//! * **4** (the fuse, 130 ticks unless set): in each second's first 10 ticks its sound 0 and its glow 0x800000c0;
//!   out, 5.
//! * **5**: it goes off: its sound 1, a sphere of 4 at 1 up (4, flags 0x10001), the big explosion toward the camera
//!   (crate::moby::classes::explosion); hidden without collision; 6.
//! * **6**: 60 ticks, then back home when nothing is within 1.2 at 1.3 and 2.3 above it (else 30 more): shown, a target
//!   with collision, teleported in (crate::moby::classes::teleport); 1.
//! * **The shake**: when its timer runs out, the camera's up-and-down shake 0.1 for 30 ticks and its roll 0.1 for 60.
//!
//! **The wall 0x10f6** (`0x422a78`): **0** its uid done: deleted; else 1 (the table `0x259a30`'s 16 records cleared:
//! the wall pieces' own, see below). **1**: a hit with the flags 0x10000 from a bomb 0x0cfc whose place is at most 0.5
//! under the wall's: every member of its group to 2. **2**: three blasts in a row across it (`0x403f10`: 0.75, 5 of
//! each sprite, 5 puffs, 5 streaks; at (−8 / 0 / 8, −6, 5) in its frame), 230 ticks, then the row at 15 up and 10 ticks
//! (3). **3**: the row at 25 up; its uid counted, the help slot 0x3c shut, its pieces thrown (`0x32d008`: −5..5 across,
//! −15..−30 out, 4..15 up, 90..360°/s, gravity 10..20, its sound 0); deleted.
//!
//! Not ported:
//! * The terminal's view words (`0x1b9c14` / `0x1b9c28` / `0x1b9c29`: the field of view asked for, `$gp+0x1118` =
//!   180.0 on the way in and 64.42 on the way out, both read by `0x2d8740` as radians — the port's field of view is
//!   fixed) and the steering screen's overlay (`0x30ee50(0x3c8618, 0x3c8620, 0)`: the view's number and three texts,
//!   0x2be5 / 0x2dea / 0x3077 / 0x3078, and the skill point's mark; off by `0x30eea0(0)`): the port has no draw hook
//!   for a class's screen text.
//! * `0x32bf48`'s byte `0x18b05a`; the crane's `+0x9c` and mode 0x400 (nothing in the port reads them); `$gp+0x3a88`
//!   (`0x1b2a78` = −1 in the crane's set-up).
//! * The hook's place is the arm's last joint (list 2) without the manipulators, moved down by the drop as list 2's
//!   (its lists 0..2 are the root's children 1..3; the engine's joint does not apply manipulators). The original reads
//!   the joint as the last frame's pose left it.
//! * The wall's pieces' own update (`0x423008`, given to `0x32d008` when its `[0]` is set: the table `0x259a30`).
//! * `0x420768`'s and the boxes' moby `+0xa8` (the hit record let go) where nothing reads it after.
