//! Oozla's boss, **Swamp Monster II** (0x0a54, L01 `0x3c1db8`, unit U75), the transporter into its arena (0x0e38, L01
//! `0x401540`, U101; the same code on level 8) and the two classes the boss makes: its spit ball (0x0b24, made by
//! `0x3db7a8`, its update `0x3dc040`) and its reward (0x1250, made by `0x418748`, its update `0x4179c0`).
//!
//! **The transporter 0x0e38.** Its pvars: `[0]` the area that sends Ratchet (−1 none), `+4` (16 bits) level 8's
//! scene switch, `+6` (16 bits) a planet unlocked at the end (−1 none), `[2]` the chunk it switches to (−1 none),
//! `[3]` the cuboid Ratchet is put at (−1: none), `[4]` / `[5]` the music's stinger and track asked for at the end,
//! `[6]` set: Ratchet need not be on the ground. Oozla's: area 66, chunk 1, cuboid 188, music 10 / 8, `[6]` 1.
//! * **0**: with its mission (`+0xb0`) done it goes (`0x307440`); else 1. (The empty pvars only print.)
//! * **1**: poked (`+0xbc`), or Ratchet in its area (`0x320388`; on the ground unless `[6]`): updated at any distance,
//!   the screen faded out over 20 frames with the game stopped (`0x2dd378(0x14)`, [`GameState::blocking_fade`]),
//!   Ratchet put at the cuboid `[3]` (`0x2b9b38(.., −1, 1)`: his state kept, the camera reset), the chunk switch
//!   (`0x2f9bd8([2], 0)`, crate::moby::Ctx::switch_chunk), 3.
//! * **3**: once no scene is asked for or playing (`0x367d78`), the planet `+6` unlocked and its banner
//!   (`0x318628`, `0x31a580`); 4.
//! * **4**: its mission done (`0x309060`) with the checkpoint at its own place (`0x34fea8`) when it was not, Ratchet
//!   idle (`0x2c1ca8(0)`, `0x2beea8(0, 1)`), the music `[5]` / `[4]` asked for (`0x3245e8`), and it goes.
//!
//! **The boss 0x0a54** stands in the arena of chunk 1 at its height `+0x2e8`, on the framework
//! ([`crate::moby::ai`]): health block `+0x20` (its damages: bytes `+0x34` the bites and the spit, `+0x35` the grab's
//! swipe, `+0x36` the throw), its colour flash `+0x50`, reaction `+0x60` (a hurt: sub-state 6, the state kept), target
//! `+0x110`, movement `+0x130` (radius 4, the fence path `+0x2c4`). Every tick ([`checks`], `0x3c15c8`): the damage —
//! its health out (or `+0x2e` = 2, a kill asked from outside: its death reaction, sub 6) pokes the cutaway `+0x2f8`
//! and puts it at the cuboid `+0x2fc`; the target (area `+0x2f0`); its camera tweak (`+0x2e4`: the camera 10 behind
//! Ratchet facing it, field of view 79°; 20 while it spits or holds him); the boss bar (`0x2f20b8`, picture 2) while
//! Ratchet is under 20 above it and it fights (sub-states 2..6). At the end ([`tail`], `0x3c1548`): its flash, its
//! ticks, the waits `+0x2da` / `+0x2dc` / `+0x2de` counted down; and Ratchet drowned (`0x2b3d20`) once more than 1.8
//! under the swamp's water, 1 under the boss and within 10 of it.
//!
//! **Sub-states** (`+0x95`):
//! * **0** set-up ([`setup`], `0x3c1250`; with its mission done the moby `+0x308` is poked and it goes), 1.
//! * **1** once it has its target: the fight's music (`[0x310]` / `[0x318]`) and its camera tweak (priority 5), 2.
//! * **2** the fight ([`fight`]): [`approach`] (`0x3c1810`): farther than `+0x2ec` it walks (sequence `+0x2e1`) to
//!   Ratchet, or round the arena (38 from the cuboid `+0x2cc`, 5° a step) while he is more than 15° round from it;
//!   nearer it turns to him in place (`+0x2e2`). Its mode `+0xbc` picks the attacks by his distance and the angle
//!   to him: the lunge ([`lunge`], state 1, sequence 6 / 7), the spit ([`spit`], 2, 0xd), the swing ([`swing`], 3, 8),
//!   the grab ([`grab`], 4, 0xe), each with its wait; farther than 40 it wades away (sequence 4, faster turns) and
//!   comes back up (0x16) within 15. Under two thirds of its health it roars (0x10) into the second mode set (3..6:
//!   the grab, then swings and lunges), under a third into the third (7..9).
//! * **3** the attack ([`attack`]): the lunge's jaws sweep (frames 44..68: spheres of 0.5 on joints 1, 2 or 5, 6 and
//!   lines between them, jittered 0.3), the swing's arm hits (frames 34..41, joint 8 or 9, 2.2), the spit at frame 16
//!   (a 0x0b24 from joint 10, 14 a second across, solved for 9.8 of gravity, `0x3140e8`), the grab (frames 12..17:
//!   Ratchet within 3.9 of joint 12 (2.4 lower) is caught, `+0x2f4`; frames 17..19 its swipe at joint 12 or 13).
//!   Caught, he is held at joint 10 ([`hold_hero`], `0x3c1ca8`); at the sequence's end he is bitten (`+0x36`; under
//!   2 health dead) and thrown (4, sequence 0xb); else back to 2.
//! * **4** the throw: it turns side-on to the arena's middle; past frame 33 Ratchet is let go (0x16) and, while he is
//!   within 13 of joint 14, pushed along its facing 20 a second, and up by 0.7 of that times `(1 − d/150)²`.
//! * **5** a roar or a wade's end: at the sequence's end back to 2. **6** the knock (the framework's flight): dead → 7.
//! * **7** dying: frozen (its animation stopped, hidden, no target), its reward 0x1250 made at its place (half a unit
//!   lower; [`make_reward`], `0x418748`), Ratchet held (0x6f); the reward's path `+0x2a0` from Ratchet to it, 1 higher,
//!   0.85 of it; 8.
//! * **8** the reward flies to Ratchet over 160 ticks (`+0x2ac` from 1 down by 0.00625, 4 high at the middle), its
//!   show's place 2.5 from Ratchet toward the boss; Ratchet kept at the cutaway's cuboid; the cutaway played while
//!   poked (`0x395620`). Once the reward is gone (taken): its bolts (`0x310b28(m, 0, 3)`), its mission done, then (with
//!   a cuboid `+0x304`) the 16-frame fade, chunk 0 (`0x2f9bd8(0, 0)`), Ratchet at that cuboid idle with the camera
//!   reset and the checkpoint there; the moby `+0x308` poked, the music `+0x314` / `+0x31c`, and it goes.
//!
//! Its sounds are on chunk 1's bank 2 (crate::audio::chunk); the update plays none itself.
//!
//! **Its rewards**: its bolts, its mission, and the reward 0x1250 that gives the item 0x32 (`0x2e99e8(0x32)`, message
//! 0x129a). No skill point.
//!
//! **The spit ball 0x0b24** (`0x3dc040`): it grows to 1.6 its class's scale (0.025 of the way a tick), moves by its
//! velocity `[0]`, its sequence 1 after the first; touching anything (a sphere of 1.6, `0x2d5048`, not its owner
//! `[4]`, not a 0x0660) or under the water it splashes: the general explosion (`0x3165d8`,
//! crate::moby::blast::explode: a sphere of 2 hits for its damage `[6]`, flags 0x810001; its flashes and four embers),
//! two lines 6 down from Ratchet's moby (`0x3132c8`, 0.0001), and it goes. Else gravity 9.8 a second²; out of
//! 2..1021 it goes.
//!
//! **The reward 0x1250** (`0x4179c0`) is the platinum bolt's show (crate::moby::classes::platinum) with its own
//! prize: with the item 0x32 already had it goes; carried by the boss (state 1, turning); Ratchet within 3 across and 2
//! up takes it: with `+0xc` (16 bits) set at once (message 0x3315, the item, its sound 1), else the show
//! (platinum's `0x398500`, the camera `0x4183f8`) and at its end the message 0x129a, the item, Ratchet idle, the
//! camera behind him.
//!
//! The autosaves (`0x303030(0, −1)`, crate::game::GameState::autosave): the transporter's at its end when it has a
//! mission or a planet (`+0x6`), the reward's after its show.
//!
//! Not ported: the blocking fades of the reward's show (`0x2dd378(10)`); the companion moby 0x0660 the boss makes (`0x3a7680`); its tail's aim
//! (`0x31cfa0`, G-ENM-001); the cutscene lock `0x18c0d5` it sets while it holds Ratchet and Ratchet's `0x18a010`;
//! the path lengths `0x338aa8` its paths are given (the port's paths carry none); the 0x0b24's trail and splash
//! particles (`0x3dbbe8`, `0x3db898`, G-PRT-001); the reward's rings and sparkles (`0x418188`,
//! `0x418610`: their random draws are left out), its vehicle check (`0x18c0d4` 3: `0x2b37f0`); the flag
//! `0x1b22a8` the transporter and the reward hold; level 8's scene switch of the transporter (`+4` = 0 there).
//!
//! The port's own steps: the original stops the game inside the tick for a blocking fade and goes on after it; here
//! the fade is asked for ([`GameState::blocking_fade`]) and the rest waits for the next tick — the transporter's
//! state 2 and the boss's sub-state 9.
