//! angles turned to the up ([`align_up`]), ¾ of its size, its life 1200 ticks, the shots the row's `+0x48`, its look
//! ahead, its joint node on list 0 (`0x37f060`). By state:
//! * **0**: its index (`gp−0xf4`, counted mod 100), no collision; **1** (flying): its rows to the up, it moves, falls 11
//!   a second² and sweeps ([`sweep`], `0x37edb8`: a 0.1 sphere 0.074 up its up row, else the line from its last
//!   place; not Ratchet nor the glove): off a wall (less than 0.5556 up) or a moby of class type 5 it bounces (the
//!   normal speed ×0.45); stopped on another turret (0x00cb, 0x1366, 0x1367) it flies on 1.1 times as fast. Landed:
//!   still, the moby under it kept, by the surface's kind (`0x3813b0`): water (0, 0xd, 0xe) — it sinks (**7**, 0.025 a

//!   sound 1, sequence 1, **2**; else **6**. Its collision on.
//! * **2** (unfolding): its frame at 6 → sequence 2, **3** (searching, [`search`] `0x3889a8`): the aim search all round
//!   within 15 of its joint 0 (crate::moby::aim::search, no crates) — a target: **4**, the cooldown 0; with none and a
//!   new look wanted, one 45..90° either way from its look and −0.1..0.45 up. **4** (tracking, [`track`] `0x388b98`):
//!   its want the way to the target's aim point (a target gone, dead or out of the target list: **3**); it fires
//!   ([`fire`] `0x388cc8`) with the cooldown out, aimed and a target: from its joint 1 at the row's speed toward the aim
//!   point, class sound 0, its shot ([`Shot`], `0x389388`), the muzzle flash 6 ticks, its life 1200 again, a shot less
//!   (none left: **8**), the cooldown 1 / the row's rate. The moby under it gone (state −2 / −3): no collision, **1**.
//! * In 3 and 4 the look turns ([`turn`], `0x388e98`: from its look-from toward its want by `1 − (1 − s)²` of the share
//!   `s`, which grows 1.5° a tick; aimed past 0.9; at 1 a new look is wanted), its joint node the look's frame
//!   (`0x388f80`); the 0.2 sphere at its joint 0 (flags 2) meeting the world blows it up (`0x388888`, **8**); out of the
//!   ready set it folds (sequence 1 from frame 9 played backward, **5**, its node let go, the look back to its
//!   look-from). **5**: its frame at 1 → sequence 0, **6** (folded): back in the ready set → class sound 1, sequence 1,
//!   a new node, **2**.
//! * **7** (sinking, `0x388740`): it moves, falls 11 a second² / 10, the line from its last place (flags 0x10) meeting
//!   anything: **8**; one tick in five a bubble (`0x3887d8`, crate::particles::water::bubble). **8**: class sound 3, the
//!   smoke burst (`0x3210a8(0.5, 13)`, crate::moby::blast::smoke_burst), hidden (`+0x34 | 0x41`), **9**: once its shots
//!   are spent, its node and slot let go, gone.
//!
//! Every tick: the cooldown runs down; its life out or Ratchet dying (0x6f) → **8**; its shots step ([`step_shots`],
//! `0x389438`); below 8 standing on a moby it rides its move (`0x3888e8`; on a class of type 0x12 whose pvar byte
//! `+0x14` is 0 it sinks, **7**); its draw (`0x389818`).
//!
//! **The ready set** (the table `0x238500`: 64 turrets, their ready flags `+0x100`, the count `+0x220`, a flag `+0x224`,
//! the most `+0x228` = 5, `0x3892c0`): once a frame before the moby loop (`0x37fa28` → `0x389368`) and at each landing,
//! the five turrets nearest Ratchet are ready ([`Table::refresh`]); the others fold.
//!
//! **The shots** ([`Shot`], 100 records of 0x30 bytes at `0x237240`: `+0x00` the place, `+0x10` the velocity, `+0x20`
//! the life in seconds (120), `+0x24` the turret): each tick of its turret ([`step_shots`]) a shot out of the world's
//! 2..1021 box or its life out goes; else it moves and the line from its last place (flags 0, its turret left out)
//! meeting the world, a moby neither in the target list nor of class type 5, Ratchet or another turret ends it with 3
//! sparks; another moby takes the row's damage (flags 0x210000 along its way, kind `0x1366 << 16 | 0x0305`) and 6
//! sparks ([`sparks`], `0x38a5d0`: twinkles, red and white, flying out and toward the camera).
//!
//! **The draw** ([`draw`], `0x389818`): while the flash's ticks run down (the draw counts them), the muzzle flash
//! (`0x389b60`: a glow at joint 1 (`0x389860`) and two orange streaks 2..4 out along its look, FX 0x17); then each of its
//! shots (`0x3896e8` → `0x38a268`): a red glow (`0x389f90`, FX 0xb) and two streaks (FX 0xe) back 2.1 steps.
//!
//! Its glow in the hand (`0x2a7ed8`'s case 0x29, the Spiderbot Glove's): crate::hero::items.
//!
//! **The upgraded glove** (rows 0x40, 0x59, 0x5a, crate::hero::items::UPGRADE_ROWS): its hand **0x0a65** (`0x3c9c70`,
//! the hand above but for the turret it throws, its marker `0x3c9ea0`) throws **0x1367** (made by `0x38bb30`, updated by
//! `0x38a9a8`): the turret above with its own ready set (`0x238d70`, `0x38bdc8`), its full size, 10 shots (not the
//! row's `+0x48`), the sweep's sphere 0.13 lifted 0.0962, unfolded from frame 6.5, its head's sphere 0.25 and no shot
//! records: a shot ([`fire`], `0x38b770`) is its class sound 0 and a **plasma shot 0x0a82** (`0x3cb8f0(2, 15, 0.5, 3,
//! muzzle, way, 0x50, 200, 1, 0, 0x10e, target)`, the glove its owner), the cooldown 2/3 s (not the row's rate). Its
//! draw (`0x38bde8`) is the muzzle flash. The original keeps its target at `+0x64` and the glove at `+0x68`; the port
//! keeps the base turret's pvars.
//!
//! **The plasma shot** ([`update_plasma`], `0x3cadc0`; pvars: `+0x00` its velocity, `+0x10..+0x40` its trail's four
//! points, `+0x50` its target, `+0x54` its turn's spring, `+0x58` / `+0x5c` its spiral's phases, `+0x60` its speed (a
//! second; 2), `+0x64` its trail's scroll, `+0x68` its top speed (15), `+0x6c` (s16) its smoke's count, `+0x70` its
//! speed's growth a tick (0.5), `+0x74` its damage (3), `+0x78` / `+0x79` its smoke's life (0x50..200), `+0x7a` its
//! smoke's interval (1), `+0x7b` the wide homing (0), `+0x7c` no search (made without a target), `+0x7d` the trail's
//! shift timer, `+0x7e` (u16) its life (270 ticks)); size 0.015, its rows kept. **0**: its trail laid behind it (0.3
//! back along its way, three more points 0.01 on), **1**. Each tick its trail's scroll −0.1 (wrapping at −8); its
//! target gone (state −x) or without collision is dropped and, free to search, the first moby within 15 (flags 0) of
//! the target list, not 0x0a7e nor Ratchet, of class type 5 is taken; its rows along its way (row 1 the world's up ×
//! it); it moves; its life out, or out of the world's 2..1021 box (put back), **2** hidden. The 0.25 sphere at it
//! (flags 0x10, itself left out), else the step's line, meeting anything but a turret: every moby within 1 of mode
//! 0x1000 / 0x4000 takes its damage (flags 0x210000 along its velocity, kind `0x0a82 << 16 | 0x0305`), a smoke burst
//! (`0x3210a8(1, 13, shot, point, 0)`), **2** hidden. Its speed the least of its speed and its top (then +0.5 a tick).
//! With a target it homes ([`home`], `0x321de8(0.03, 0.2, 0, 0.25, …)`, the spring `0x2d7f80`) on the target's aim
//! point spiralled by its phases (`sin b · min(0.749 d, 0.749)` across, `cos b · min(0.751 d, 0.751)` back, `(sin a +
//! 1) · min(d / 2, 0.5)` up; d its distance, 0 under 0.25). Every tick a smoke puff (crate::particles::plasma,
//! `0x342740`) 0.3 behind it, half the step large, its ALPHA 0x48 / 0x44 in turn; the phases step (b +0.01..0.1, a
//! −0.025..0.25); every second tick its trail shifts on, the newest its tail. **2**: gone. Its row 1's y and row 2's z
//! are halved after the tail is taken (the model's squash). The draw ([`draw_plasma`], `0x3cbaa0` → `0x3cbad0`, state
//! 1): the glow `0x2ed370` (crate::fx::halo) at its tail and the streak `0x2ed6d8(scroll, 0.25, tail, trail, 4)`
//! (crate::fx::streak), both `0x103080`.
//!
//! The weapon mod: Shock on the moby a shot hits (`0x4126b8(m, 0x29, the hand)`) and on each moby the upgraded glove's
//! plasma hits (`0x4126b8(m, 0x40, the hand)`; crate::moby::weapon_mods).
//!
//! Not ported (the upgraded glove): the free mobys' check of the shot's make (`0x1b1d40` below 0x11: none), the
//! search's class list (`$gp−0x90`: {0, 0x1367}, of no class of type 5). (The turret's flight keeps a tracker, `+0x4f`,
//! rides the level's moving frame and falls along the frames' up: crate::gravity.) The level's moving frame (`0x1adb0c`, the tables `0x238730` / `0x2388c0` by the turret's
//! index: what it lands on carries it with its turn; null on the ported levels), the water's ripple (`0x37d5a0`, with
//! the ripple module: G-REN-009), the water's patch and plane
//! heights for the bubbles (`0x31d7a0`: the bubble's own height here, as the port's water does); the shots' line through the gravity frames (`0x380e58`). The original keeps the table's
//! moby pointers and the shots' owners as pointers; the port keeps moby indices.
