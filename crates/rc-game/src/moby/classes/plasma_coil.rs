//! and 12 an arc (`+0x64`), 15 ammo, its upgrade row 0x3e): the hand moby **0x0c4a** (`0x3e9608`, called by the item
//! pass while it is the hand item; no Ghidra function there, read from the assembly) and the plasma ball it fires
//! **0x0a9b** (`0x3cbb78`, made by `0x3ccdc8`).
//!
//! **The hand** (pvars: `+0x00` the cooldown (seconds), `+0x04` its trail slot, `+0x08` the slot's memory, `+0x10` the
//! coil's spin, `+0x14` its angle, `+0x20` the joint node on list 0 whose rotation `+0x30` spins the coil). State **0**:
//! past its draw-out (sequence B not 0, or the sequence wrapped) its sequence 1; the node (`0x312480`); the cooldown
//! 22 ticks (0.3667 s), the spin 0, state **1**; the phase (`$gp+0x1690`) 0; the class's trail slot
//! (crate::moby::classes::chopper::Pool, `0x32b1b8`); the four arcs drawn about the hand ([`HandArc`], `0x24f740`)
//! drawn anew; the balls' table cleared (`0x3cd028`). **1**, each tick: Ratchet in the look stance 1 goes to its twin
//! 0x1d; in 0x1d the look wait (`0x18c354`) counts down and the screen-centre crosshair shows (`0x2db498`, FX 0x26: red
//! `0x600000ff` while the cooldown runs with ammo left, else green `0x600fff0f`), else the wait is 0x28. The aim
//! (`0x3260c0`, crate::moby::aim::search_lock: the Lock On mod's lock first, crates too): from 0.75 up Ratchet's up row along his way (`0x18a580`), 20 far,
//! 10° by 10° (45° by 45° near him); ready with ammo left, its pick shows the green reticle (FX 0x26, `0xff0fff0f`,
//! `|0.9 − d·0.0067·0.65|` large at the camera's distance d) on its aim point. The cooldown runs down; out, the items
//! not kept away, ○ held, the wait out, fewer than 4 balls out and in the hand past 0x16 ticks: one ammo — taken, the
//! class sound 2 and the latch (`0x1b2af0`); the phase from 0 (the spin to 0.1) or 2 goes to **spinning up** (1) and
//! the cooldown to 0.5 — none left: ○ pressed or the latch set, the class sound 7 and the latch cleared. The phases:
//! idle (0) the spin rises 0.1 a tick to 0.1; spinning up (1) it rises 0.1 a tick and past 1 the ball goes — from
//! joint 0 along Ratchet's way (the arm raised at a wall: the gun's −row 1), turned toward a moby at the muzzle
//! (`0x2e14b0(1)`: a target, not Ratchet, not 0xc87 / 0xecc) and then toward the aim's pick, through [`spawn`] —
//! and the phase goes to **spinning down** (2): the spin falls 0.01 a tick back to 0.1, then idle. Drawn, the hand's
//! draw is asked for. The coil turns −spin·π/10 a tick about its joint's y (the node's rotation `(0, sin a/2, 0,
//! cos a/2)`).
//!
//! **The ball** (pvars: `+0x00` its velocity, `+0x10` its timer, `+0x14` its index in the table `0x247240`, `+0x18` its
//! size (2.5), `+0x1c` its arcs out, `+0x20` its loop sound, `+0x38` the moby it struck, `+0x3c` the hand's trail slot,
//! `+0x40` the hand's class). Made ([`spawn`], `0x3ccdc8`; none with 4 out): at the muzzle, flying 1 a tick, 160
//! ticks, updated and drawn at any distance; the first ball after a level's load clears the rays and arcs (`$gp+0x10fc`,
//! the trail slot's memory); 20 rays started ([`start_ray`], `0x3cc980`). Each tick ([`update_ball`]):
//! * **1**: it moves; a moby within 0.45 (`0x2e14b0`) that is a target (mode 0x1000), not the hand's class nor Ratchet,
//!   is struck: the ball on its aim point, the row's damage (flags 0x210000, along its way at 1/30, kind `0x0a9b << 16 |
//!   0x0301`), sparks there ([`sparks`], `0x3ce060(10, 1)`), **2** for 15 ticks; else its step meets the world (the line,
//!   flags 2, then a sphere of 0.1): 0.1 out from the face, sparks (`0x3ce060(15, 0)`), **2** for 15 ticks. Its timer
//!   out, **4**.
//! * **2**: it rides the struck moby's aim point; its timer out, **4**, and the search (crate::moby::aim::search_list:
//!   all round, 10 far, no crates, 3 at most, not the struck moby, not the classes 0 / 0x0a9b) — each moby found takes
//!   five arcs ([`start_arc`], `0x3cc1f0`, 10 ticks to reach it) and the class sound 1.
//! * **4**: on a struck moby (its class sound 3 the first time in the level, `$gp+0x10f4`, never cleared), riding it;
//!   with no arcs out it is gone (`0x3cd060`) — over no moby, sparks (`0x3ce060(10, 1)`) and the class sound 2.
//! Its loop sound (class sound 0) plays while not 4. Then its arcs ([`step_arcs`], `0x3cc4c0`) and rays
//! ([`step_rays`], `0x3cca98`) step; its trail slot still its hand's (`0x32b388`), its draw is asked for, else it is
//! deleted (the count left as it is: the hand's next draw-out clears it).
//!
//! **An arc** (12 in the slot's memory, `0xa0` bytes): from the ball to its moby's aim point, growing to it over 10
//! ticks while its wobble turns 100 times as fast; reached, the moby (with a collision) takes the row's `+0x64` once
//! (flags 0x210000, along it at 1/30) and sparks (`0x3ce060(10, 1)`); it lasts 20 ticks more. Its two control points
//! wobble (three angles each, their speeds 0.001..0.05 either way, amplitudes 3.25..6.75 and 1.25..4.75).
//! **A ray** (64, `0x30` bytes): a way from the ball (length 0.7..0.9, a fresh unit way on renewal), 20..50 ticks, its
//! texture scrolling 0.01..0.075 a tick.
//!
//! **The ball's draw** (`0x3cd2d8`): each arc ([`draw_arc`], `0x3cd940`) — 24 points along the cubic between its ends
//! and control points, jittered 0.075, the last extrapolated, as a strip ([`strip`], `0x3cdb88`: FX 0x2b `0xafafaf`
//! 0.02..0.1 across and `0xff0000` 0.15..0.3 across at a third, fixed alpha 0..0x40 in its last 10 ticks, else
//! 0x40..0x80) and, reached, two sprites at its end (FX 0x31: 0.5 `0x103080`, 0.3 white, alpha 0x50..0x60); each ray
//! ([`draw_ray`], `0x3ccc50`: FX 0x2f in `0x800000` and FX 0x30 in white over it, the ball's size / 4 across at the ball
//! and half at its end, alpha pulsing over its life); then four sprites on the ball (`0x3cd478`: FX 0x31 0.5·size
//! `0x103080` and 0.3·size white at 0x50..0x60, FX 0xb 0.7·size `0x803010` at 8..0x16 and 0.45·size at 0x20..0x40).
//!
//! **The hand's draw** (`0x3e9f18`, [`draw_hand`]): its four arcs' wobble steps (`0x3eaae0`); five points about its
//! joints (`0x29ade0` turned by joint 0's frame: the ball point at −0.4 wobbling, `0x3eb560`) — glints at each (`0x3eaf80`:
//! FX 0x2c sprites, 0.08 toward the camera), the ball point's `0x7f00397f` / `0x7f0072ff` sized by the spin; a
//! lightning strip ([`hand_strip`], `0x3eac00` → `0x3eb010`: 10 points along the cubic jittered 0.04, FX 0x2b 0.0125
//! across and FX 0xe 0.053 across, fixed alpha 0x80 / 0x2a) from joint 0's point to the ball point, from each of the
//! three prongs' points to a point beside the ball point (0.45·spin across) and from joints 1..3 to the prongs' points;
//! one time in 11 a pair of twinkles at the points beside the ball (spinning past 0.1) and at one of the four points
//! ([`spark`], `0x3eb608`, still: its velocity is cleared before use).
//!
//! Its glow in the hand (`0x2a7ed8`'s case 0x1c, crate::hero::items): its word pulses `0xff202020` .. `0xffefefef`.
//!
//! The weapon mod: Acid on the moby the ball strikes and on an arc's target (`0x3f9f70(m, 0x1c, the hand)`,
//! crate::moby::weapon_mods, which also draws its Shock arcs with this file's strip and sparks).
//!
//! The gravity frames (crate::gravity): the ball rides the level's moving frame at the tick's start (`0x380e08`), keeps a
//! tracker (`+0x44`, `0x37f538(ball, 0, 1, 1, 1)`) that turns its velocity before each step (`0x37f618`) and gives it
//! back when it goes (`0x37f5f8`).
//!
//! Not ported: the aim at
//! the Lock On mod's lock (`0x18b270`, mirrored as the tick's aim by crate::moby::lock_on; its `0x32b4d0` path), the loop sound's random pitch
//! (`0x360a10`; its random draw is kept), the GS test register the draws set (`0x37c948`), the ball point's spring
//! (`0x31ec88`: the update resets it every tick, so the draw always snaps), the words `$gp+0x1694` / `$gp+0x1698` the
//! shot writes and nothing reads, the strips' fixed alpha (ALPHA 0x68) as the vertex alpha of an additive quad (the
//! texture's alpha is not left out). The upgraded Plasma Coil, the Plasma Storm (rows 0x3e / 0x65 / 0x66), is
//! crate::moby::classes::plasma_storm; it shares the hand's twinkles ([`spark`]) and strips.
//! The second strip of `0x3eb010` takes its second corner's colour from the stack (the store meant for it goes to
//! the first strip's): here the first corner's.
