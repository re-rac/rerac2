//! The Pulse Rifle (item 0x17, crate::hero::items::ROWS; L00's record `0x263920`: attachment 0, stance 2 (both hands),
//! use sequence 0x36, the firing arm's 0x46 crouched and none moving, icon 0xea68, name 0x32e6, shots 400 a second,
//! one a second, damage 10, 8 shots): the hand moby **0x05cb** (`0x3a4310`, called by the item pass while it is the
//! hand item) and its shot **0x05d6** (`0x3a92a8`, made by `0x3a9060`; no model: its smoke and beam are its draw's).
//!
//! **The hand** (pvars: `+0x00` (s16) in first person last tick, `+0x02` (s16) the shot's delay, `+0x04` the cooldown
//! (seconds), `+0x08` the view's angle at the start, `+0x0c` the zoom's angle, `+0x10` the muzzle light
//! (crate::point_lights, −1 none), `+0x14` its ticks, `+0x18` its trail slot, `+0x20` the zoom's loop sound, `+0x28` the
//! shots fired, `+0x2c` (s16) the scope has a target, `+0x2e` (s16) its blink, `+0x30` the target; the port keeps the
//! view turn's globals it saved (`$gp+0x5d4..0x5e0`) at `+0x40..0x48`). Put away (`0x18b064` = 3) once started, and once
//! when Ratchet enters the state 0x6f (to its state 4, back to 1 after), it puts the first-person view's turn back
//! ([`crate::first_person::Tune`]), the field of view back to the play's (`0x2d7a60(1.1243, 0.005, 0.2, 0, 0, 3)`,
//! crate::camera::FovBlend) and lets the light go. Its sequence run out, back to 1 (blend 2).
//!
//! State **0**: the cooldown 0.3667 s, state **3**; the view's angle `2·atan(0x1bd2f0)` kept, the zoom a quarter of the
//! way from it to 10°; the turn's globals saved; the class's trail slot taken (crate::moby::classes::chopper::Pool,
//! `0x32b1b8`) and its smoke and beams cleared (`0x3a9938`, [`Mem`]). **3**: the cooldown runs out → **1**.
//!
//! In first person (`0x18b320`) past state 0, every frame with the counter's bit 4 (`0x1b1948 & 4`) the scope looks 128
//! out along the view (flags 0x10, Ratchet left out): a drawn crate, or a moby of class type 5 with health left, is its
//! target. With the look wait out (`0x18c354`): a target blinks (`+0x2e` 0..20, from 11 on) the lock marker (1.5, FX
//! 0x20, `0x400000ff`) while the rifle is ready with ammo; and the crosshair (2, FX 0x27: red `0x600000ff` while the
//! cooldown runs with ammo, else green `0x600fff0f`) at the screen's centre (`0x2db498`, crate::hud::marker).
//!
//! **1** (ready): from the look stance 1 Ratchet goes to its twin 0x1d. Out of first person the look wait is 0x28 and a
//! zoom left (`+0x00`) blends the field of view back to the start's (0.005, 0.2), the zoom a quarter of the way to 10°
//! again; its sound stops. In first person the look wait counts down (a shot waits it out), and R1 (pad 8) zooms in
//! while the angle is over 10°, R2 (pad 2) out while it is under the start's, 0.01 a tick, each with its class sound (2
//! in, 3 out, looping) — neither, the sound stops; the angle held to 10°..the start's; the field of view blends to it
//! (0.02, 0.2). Every tick the view's turn eases with the zoom: by `f = (angle − 10°) / (start − 10°)` the most a tick
//! from 0.6° to the saved, the input's ease (0.03, 0.4) to the saved. ○ pressed (`0x138324`) with the items not kept
//! away and the look wait out: a shot taken — the use stance (`0x2af5e0`), the delay 2, **2**, the hand's sequence 2 —
//! or, with none left, its class sound 1.
//!
//! **2**: the delay out (in first person at once): the zoom's sound stops, its class sound 0, the shot fired ([`fire`],
//! `0x3a4f88`), the cooldown 1 / the row's rate, **3**; the fifth shot asks for the help text 0x9f3 (slot 0x4a).
//!
//! **The light** (`+0x14` ticks from 30): a point light (`0x2fda20(15, 0, …, 0x7f608060)`) 1.5 ahead of the muzzle along
//! Ratchet's forward row (the arm raised at a wall: along the gun's −row 1), radius 15, green `t` with red and blue
//! `0.75·t` for `t` its ticks / 30; freed when they run out.
//!
//! **The shot** ([`fire`]): its speed the row's / 60 a tick; from the muzzle (joint 0) along Ratchet's forward row (the
//! arm raised: the gun's −row 1) — toward a lock's aim point (`0x18aa18`, `0x32b4d0`), or in first person toward what
//! the view meets 128 out (`0x380ef8`: held within 20° of his forward row); the muzzle light; the shot made
//! ([`spawn`]); a moby of class type 5 or a crate within 1 of the muzzle (`0x2e14b0`, Ratchet left out) is hit at once
//! (the shot's hit line from it); four twinkles at the muzzle (`0x33a6a0`: 7, 5 green `0x4010ff10`, 3.5, 2.5 white
//! `0xc0ffffff` / `0xb0ffffff`, 8 ticks, turning either way).
//!
//! **The shot** 0x5d6 (pvars: `+0x00` its velocity, `+0x10` (s16) its life (`128 / speed` ticks), `+0x12` (s16) 1 when
//! fired in first person, `+0x14` one over its life, `+0x18` (s16) its beam, `+0x1a` (s16) the trail slot, `+0x20` /
//! `+0x30` the view's ray's step and point in first person). Made ([`spawn`]): far 0xff, drawn, its rows along its way
//! (`0x3a9490`), the next of the three beams (`$gp+0x694`) started from the muzzle ([`make_beam`], `0x3aa258`; none in
//! the look stance's twin). Each tick ([`update_shot`]): gone once the slot is not the rifle's; it steps (in first person
//! its ray too: the hits come from the view, the smoke from the ray's start); from the second tick a puff of smoke at
//! the step's start, and every tick one halfway ([`puff`], `0x3a9aa0`); out of the world's 2..1021 box, a hit
//! ([`hit`], `0x3a9528`) or its life out, it ends (state **2**); else the slot's smoke and its beam step ([`tail`],
//! `0x3a99d0`). Ended, they step until none lives and it goes; while any lives its draw is asked for.
//!
//! **The hit** (`0x3a9528`): the step's line (flags 0, Ratchet left out) hits a moby with the row's damage (flags
//! 0x10000, its way the shot's, kind the class's `<< 16 | 0x0101`); at the point eight pairs of twinkles jittered 0.5
//! (`0x3a9668`: 10 green, 2 white, 6..16 ticks).
//!
//! **The smoke** ([`Puff`], `0x3a9aa0`, 80 in the slot): rising 0..0.1 a second along the up, turning 1..2° a tick
//! either way, its nine corners pushed out 0.00075..0.0075 a tick each, 60..90 ticks; stepped by every live shot's
//! tick (`0x3a9c08`: two shots, twice). **The beams** ([`Beam`], 3 in the slot, 60 ticks): from the muzzle and one
//! step on, both sliding 4 a second along the shot's way, to the shot.
//!
//! **The draw** ([`draw`], `0x3a9a48` → `0x3a9d70` / `0x3aa5d0`, each live shot's: all the slot's smoke and beams):
//! each puff a 3 × 3 patch facing the camera (FX 0x36 normal, then again additive 0.075·(1 − share) up), its corners
//! (`0x294a40`) pushed out and turned by its roll, `0.5 → its size` large, `0x408040` .. `0x604040` by `|sin(4π·share)|`
//! at its life's share of 128 (32 in the look stance's twin); each beam three rings of 20 (`0x294b20`, 0.2) joined by
//! FX 0x15 quads (`0x708070` at its share of 64, the muzzle's end none, its texture scrolling 0.05 a tick), over them
//! a strip 1 wide across the view (FX 0xe additive, `0x408040` at its share of 80) and one 0.1 wide (FX 0x17 additive,
//! `0x404080` at its share of 255, scrolling 0.075 a tick), both from none at the muzzle.
//!
//! Its glow in the hand (`0x2a7ed8`'s case 0x17): two green glows at its joints 2 and 3 (crate::hero::items,
//! crate::fx::HeroGlow).
//!
//! The weapon mod: Shock on the moby a shot hits (`0x4126b8(m, 0x17, the hand)`, crate::moby::weapon_mods). In
//! the ready state the Lock On mod's lock is the aim (crate::moby::lock_on::mirror). A shot starts the pad's rumble
//! (`0x2d6d60(0x2947c0)`, its handle `+0x24`), stopped at the ready state's end (crate::rumble::weapon_stop).
//!
//! The level's moving frame (crate::gravity): the shot takes its start's move on it (`0x380e58`) and, ended, rides it
//! (`0x380e08`).
//!
//! Not ported: the moving frames' aims (`$gp−0x14e4`: their aim straight at a lock or the scope's target, the shot's
//! mode 2), the LOD ranges the zoom widens (`0x36a1c0`, `0x1aa100`: the
//! engine's LOD is its own), `0x18ccd0` (set to 0xffff while zooming; no reader on Aranos), the impact's upgraded branch
//! (`0x3a9668` → `0x320538` and a sphere of the row's `+0x64`: the upgraded rows swap the hand for the Vaporizer's,
//! crate::moby::classes::vaporizer, whose own shot never comes here).
//!
//! Shared with the Vaporizer: the scope ([`scope_at`]), the way out ([`put_back`]), the first-person aim ([`view_aim`]),
//! the beams' step and draw ([`step_beam_at`], [`draw_beam`] in a [`BeamLook`]).
