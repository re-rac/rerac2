//! The Minirocket Tube (item 0x1b, crate::hero::items::ROWS; L00's record `0x263ca0`: attachment 0, stance 2 (both
//! hands), use sequence 0x36, the firing arm's 0x46 crouched and none moving, icon 0xea70, name 0x32f3, its upgrade's row
//! 0x45 (`+0x3a`), the rockets' speed 60 a second, 1.7 a second, damage 12, the blast's 6 (`+0x64`), 25 rockets): the
//! hand moby **0x05cf** (`0x3a5d00`, called by the item pass while it is the hand item) and the rocket **0x05da**
//! (`0x3ad308`, made by `0x3ace00`; the update has no Ghidra function on any level: read from its listing).
//!
//! **The hand** (pvars: `+0x00` the cooldown (seconds), `+0x10` the lock, `+0x14` the lock's hold, `+0x18` its aim
//! height, `+0x1c` (s16) the muzzle's point light (crate::point_lights, −1 none), `+0x1e` (s16) the light's ticks,
//! `+0x20` the last search's pick, `+0x24` the ticks it must stay picked, `+0x28` in the look last tick, `+0x2c` the
//! pad rumble's handle; the port keeps the empty click's flag `0x1b27e4` at `+0x04`). State 0: the light none, the pick

//! runs; the cooldown runs down; the look stance 1 goes to its twin 0x1d; its sequence run out, back to 1 (blend 2).
//! * **The look** (0x1d with Ratchet hidden: the view lock, crate::first_person): entering it drops the lock (the
//!   count 5); the crosshair (`0x2db498(1.25, 0, 90°, hand, …, FX 0x27, −1, 4)`: red `0x600000ff` while the cooldown
//!   runs with ammo left, else green `0x600fff0f`); the search 4° by 4° (and near). Outside it, 18° by 17°.
//! * **The aim** (`0x325f90`, crate::moby::aim::search_lock: the Lock On mod's lock first, crates too): 75 far, from 0.75 up Ratchet's up row along his
//!   forward row (`0x18a580`; the arm raised at a wall (`0x18c30c`) outside the look: the gun's −row 1). Without a
//!   lock, the same pick 5 ticks running becomes it (the hold 5, the aim height its health block's `+0x10`, else 0.1).
//!   With one — live (not state −2 / −3, health left when it has a block), drawn, the arm not raised — picked again
//!   it is held (the hold 5) and shown: the reticle FX 0x26 (`0xff0fff0f`, `|0.9 − d·0.0067·0.65|` large at the
//!   camera's distance d to it) at its aim point, Ratchet aiming at it (`0x18aa18`); not picked, the hold counts down
//!   and out drops it (the count 5); else it is dropped.
//! * **The shot**: the look wait (`0x18c354`) counts down in 0x1d, else is 0x28; outside a scene, the cooldown out,
//!   the items not kept away (`0x18c0dc`), the hand's sequence at most 1, ○ held, in the hand past 0x16 ticks and
//!   the wait out: a hand still in its draw-out sequence 0 goes to 1 (blend 4); a rocket (`0x2d42d0(−1, 1)`): the flag
//!   set; without a lock the point-blank sphere (1, flags 1, Ratchet left out) at the hand's −row 1 + 0.275 row 0 —
//!   an enemy-run moby (drawn, not dying, not 0xc87 / 0xecc, health left or a crate) not of class type 5 makes the
//!   sphere's first moby (`0x1bf198`) the lock; its class sound 0, the light's ticks 15, the burst ([`burst`],
//!   `0x3a58b0`), the rocket ([`spawn`] through `0x3a67a0`: `0x3ace00(aim height, 2, 5, 0.6, hand, joint 0, lock, 0)`,
//!   the hand its owner `+0xb8`), the use stance (standing, or walking (state 2) with the stick under 0.7: Ratchet's
//!   sequence 0x36 blended over 10 (`0x2d2508(10, 0x36, 1)`); else `0x2af5e0`), the hand's sequence 2 (no blend), the
//!   cooldown 1 / the row's rate. None left: with ○ pressed or the flag set, its class sound 1 and the flag cleared.
//! * **The light** (`0x2fdb60(8, 0, …)` / `0x2fdc48`): while the hand's sequence A is not 2 and its ticks run, a point
//!   light of radius 8 at joint 0 + the aim's way + 0.3 up Ratchet's up row, `(t, 0.8·t, 0.5·t)` for `t` rising over
//!   its first 3 ticks (`(15 − n) / 3`) then falling over 12 (`n / 12`); else freed. The hand's sequence B at 2 frees
//!   it and clears its ticks: the shot plays sequence 2 at once (`0x31b518` sets A and B), so the shot's ticks are
//!   cleared the tick they are set and the light never shows — the original's own order, kept.
//!
//! **The smoke** (`0x3a5620`, the timer down a tick, 6 ticks after a shot): from the hand's place + 0.1 row 1 + 0.275
//! row 0, riding 0.1 along row 1 a tick, four glow puffs (`0x335bb8(0.04, 1, 0.9, 52500, …, 0..15 either way,
//! 0x7f204080)`, 8 ticks) and three white ones (`0x335bb8(0.02, 1, 1, 15750 − 3150·k, …, ±16, 0x7fffffff)`, 2, 4 and 8
//! ticks, a random roll).
//!
//! **The burst** (`0x3a58b0`): the smoke's timer 6; from the hand's place + 0.3 row 0 − row 1, twenty lines
//! (crate::particles::line, `0x3352c0`: 0.75 long along their way, flying 0.1..0.3 of it a tick, `0x307f7f7f`, 0.05
//! wide, fading 2 a tick) and twenty grey sparks (`0x339848(0.4..0.75 × 210000, growing 500, drag 0.95, …, 10 ticks,
//! 0x7f, 0x404040)` jittered 0.4, flying 12..16 a second plus 1.7 × Ratchet's move on the ground, started a step
//! back), their ways Ratchet's forward row turned 20° (the sparks 12°) about his row 1, then about his row 0 by a
//! sum of 0..36° steps.
//!
//! **The rocket** (pvars: `+0x00` the target's aim point last tick, `+0x0c` the hand, `+0x10` the target, `+0x14` the
//! lock's aim height, `+0x18` its speed a tick, `+0x1c` 2..5 (0 with a lock), `+0x20` ±6..10, `+0x24` (s16) its life
//! (75 / speed ticks), `+0x26` it homes, `+0x27` its ticks (u8), `+0x28` a random angle, `+0x2c` its trail slot, `+0x30`
//! its way, `+0x40` the aim point's offset (0); `+0x1c`, `+0x20` and `+0x28` are read by nothing). Made ([`spawn`]):
//! far 0xff, drawn, its rows kept (mode 0x100); the next of the eight trail slots (`$gp+0x760`, [`Trails`]); at the
//! muzzle; its rows: the arm raised, the gun's (−row 1, −row 0, row 2); without a lock Ratchet's forward row (in first
//! person toward what the view meets 75 out, held within 30°: `0x380ef8`), with one toward its aim point, row 1 the up
//! × row 0; a lock's health block marked (`+0x1e |= 0x80`), one with `+0x0b` set not homed on; the line from the hand
//! (at the muzzle's height) to the muzzle meeting anything (flags 0, Ratchet left out) blows it up on its first tick
//! there; its exhaust point the slot's first point; its size ×2.5.
//!
//! Each tick ([`update_rocket`]): a target dying (state −2 / −3) or out of health is dropped; else its aim point (its
//! place raised along its up row by its health block's aim height). With a target homed on and life under 0x127: the
//! lead — `s = |moved| / speed · sin θ` for the target's move since last tick and θ the angle (signed by the side)
//! between it and the way back to the rocket, wrapped into ±1 (none past 100); `asin s` over 1e-5 turns the way to the
//! target by it about `(rocket − target) × moved`, row 1 the up × it; a target moving and within a step with nothing
//! between (flags 0x12, Ratchet left out) is struck. Else its rows from its way (`+0x30`). It moves a step along row 0;
//! a target of class 0xcea passed is dropped. Out of the world's 2..1021 box it is gone. Its trail's four points shift,
//! its exhaust point first; from its fourth tick its draw is asked for; its sparks ([`sparks`], `0x3adea0`); 0.25 off
//! the ground (flags 2). Then a struck target takes the hit, else the step's line (flags 0, Ratchet left out) hits what
//! it meets (`0x2de878` with the template: the row's damage, its way 1.5 long, flags 0x830000, kind the class's `<< 16
//! | 0x0103`): the world blows it up there, a moby but Ratchet and the hand blows it up there (2). Blowing up: its class
//! sound 0, the big explosion (crate::moby::classes::explosion, `0x3fabe8`) at it facing the camera (a moby struck) or
//! off the face hit, with the ground under it (`0x31ce20(0.5)`) for a moby or a wall (the face's normal under 0.1 up),
//! the blast ([`blast`], `0x3add28`), gone (a rocket the make's line already blew up whose tick meets nothing faces the
//! camera: the game reads the collision's last hit there, whatever query left it). Else its life out or 75 from
//! Ratchet: gone.
//!
//! **The blast** (`0x3add28`): every moby within 4 (flags 0x10, the rocket left out) knocked (`0x31def8(the row's
//! +0x64, 1, 1, rocket, …, flags 0x810000, 3, 1)`, crate::moby::MobyWorld::knock_hits).
//!
//! **The sparks** (`0x3adea0`): along the step from its last place, `speed·10` grey sparks (`0x339848(21000, 200..1000
//! a tick, …, 30..45 ticks)` rising 0.2..1 a second; by `rand & 2` `0x7f7f7f` at 0x40 additive, else `0x404040` at
//! 0x20 normal growing twice as fast), turning ±1..2, on the glow puffs' frame.
//!
//! **The draw** ([`draw`], `0x3ae138`): the glow (crate::fx::halo, `0x2ed370`) at its exhaust point (0.4 behind it
//! along row 0) and the streak (crate::fx::streak, `0x2ed6d8(0, 0.25, …, 4)`) through its slot's four points, both
//! `0x103080` (`$gp+0x768`).
//!
//! Its glow in the hand (`0x2a7ed8`'s case 0x1b): only on the upgraded rows (crate::hero::items).
//!
//! The weapon mod (`0x3f9f70(moby, 0x45 upgraded / 0x1b, owner)`, crate::moby::weapon_mods): Acid on the moby a rocket
//! struck and on every moby in its blast.
//!
//! The Lock On mod's lock is also the tick's aim (crate::moby::lock_on::mirror); a rocket starts the pad's rumble
//! (`0x2d6d60(0x294840)`, `+0x2c`), stopped after the shot's test (crate::rumble::weapon_stop).
//!
//! The gravity frames (crate::gravity): the rocket keeps a tracker (`+0x50`, `0x37f538(rocket, 0, 1, 1, 1)`) that turns
//! its way when it does not home (`0x37f618`), rides the level's moving frame after its move (`0x380e08`) and gives the
//! tracker back when it goes (`0x37f5f8`).
//!
//! Not ported: the way flattened to the frame at the make, the projectile list `0x1b1f30` the rocket
//! joins (`0x3216e0` / `0x321760`: no reader ported), the frame (1) of the standing use's sequence (the use stance's
//! request carries none: frame 0). The upgraded rows (row 0x45 on, the hand 0x1004) are the Megarocket Cannon,
//! crate::moby::classes::megarocket, firing these rockets.
