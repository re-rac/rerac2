//! Endako (level 3)'s boss, **0x0c8a** (L03 `0x3f5c78`, one placed; unit U201), a flying gunship with its pilot 0x0c49
//! aboard, and the shots it makes: the tracer **0x0a72** (made by `0x3dae28`, its update `0x3dab80`), the sweeping laser
//! **0x09df** (made by `0x3d1fd8`, its update `0x3d1ae8`) and the rocket **0x0b1b** (made by `0x3e2ee8`; its update
//! `0x3e2958` is the keeper's shot's code, crate::moby::classes::keeper::update_shot). L03 addresses throughout; the
//! engine functions are named by their L03 addresses (the port's L00 ones in the docs they link to).
//!
//! **pvars** (Endako's placed block): `[0]` → the health block `+0x20` (health `+0x20`, its most `+0x24`, `+0x2e` 2 a kill
//! asked from outside; the damages: `+0x34` a tracer 1, `+0x35` the laser 2, `+0x36` a rocket 3), `[0xc]` → the target
//! `+0x50`, the colour flash `+0x70`. `[0x80]` / `[0x84]` the paths of its two passes (59, 60), `[0x88]` its fight's
//! path (88); the cuboids: `[0x8c]` / `[0x90]` start a pass (36, 38), `[0x98]` / `[0x9c]` end it (37, 39), `[0x94]` the
//! fight's (40); `[0xa4]` / `[0xa8]` two mobys held (`0x32bf18`, crate::moby::Moby::once bit 2) until its end and its
//! fight; `[0xac]` the group of ammo crates it brings back; the music `[0xb0]` at the fight (18), `[0xb4]` / `[0xb8]` at
//! its end (0, 22); `+0x3d0..+0x404` its fourteen voice lines.
//!
//! **Each tick** ([`update`]): first [`senses`] (`0x3f6bd0`), then its state, then [`tail`] (`0x3f76c0`).
//! * [`senses`]: in state 0 the set-up — with its mission done it goes; its most health by the mission's rank
//!   (`0x2e50d0`: 1 × 0.7, 2 × 0.9); its six armour pieces drawn (`+0x7c` 0x3f); the next quarter `+0x334` (¾ of it);
//!   its place `+0x290` and home `+0x2b0` where it stands; hidden, no collision, not a target, waiting (1, sub 0); the
//!   first attack the laser (`+0x30b`), its side `+0x330` 1; the stops of its fight's path (the points whose `w` ≥ 0,
//!   seven at most, `+0x314..`); `[0xa8]` / `[0xa4]` held; its crates put away (`0x3f7d18` → `0x3a4478`,
//!   crate::moby::classes::crate_::put_away). Every tick: its scale 0.9 of its class's; a hit (flags 0x10000, not from
//!   its own laser 0x09df) of some damage (`0x31f150`, crate::moby::ai::damage_of) or a kill asked flashes it red
//!   (`+0x77` 0x96), plays its sound 1. Before its fight (sub 0) a hit in its first pass sends it away (3). In the
//!   fight the health goes down (a kill: to 0); out of it, dying (0xe, sub 1); under the next quarter its two pieces
//!   of the quarter `+0x308` break off (`0x2dca30` mode 1, crate::moby::shards::spawn_ball: spin 30, gravity 15,
//!   7/60 to either side and 5/60 up in its frame), the quarter counts up, the hit's reaction (0xd, sub 6) and the
//!   next quarter is the one under its health. In states 6..0xd it looks for Ratchet (`0x32c4e8(16, 8)`,
//!   crate::moby::ai::find_target). Then its voice ([`voice`], `0x3f84c8`).
//! * **States**:
//!   * **1** waiting for pass `+0x2d4` (0, 1): Ratchet in its cuboid `[0x8c + 4k]` shows it 7 below the start of the
//!     pass's path `[0x80 + 4k]` facing him, rising to it (2); in the fight's cuboid `[0x94]` it goes to wait (4).
//!   * **2** the pass: Ratchet in `[0x98 + 4k]` marks `0x1395c2` and sends it along its path to the end (3).
//!   * **3** at the end it hides: after the first pass waits for the second (1), after the second for the fight (4).
//!   * **4** Ratchet in the fight's cuboid: the scene 0x36 queued and started once (`$gp+0x203c`), 5.
//!   * **5** after 20 ticks, no scene playing: the fight (6, sub 2) — shown, a target, 7 below its fourth stop rising to
//!     it facing Ratchet, the wait `+0x2e0` 60, `[0xa8]` let go, the music `[0xb0]`.
//!   * **6** the fight (sub 2): on its first tick its sequence 0 and the next stop ([`next_stop`], `0x3f7a98`: an
//!     even one after its guns, else an odd one; never the stop it heads for); at the stop, the wait over, an attack
//!     ([`attack`], `0x3f7908`).
//!   * **7** / **8** the guns (sub 3): its two turrets (joint lists 0, 1) turn to ±40° (`+0x2f8`), then (sequence 1,
//!     2 or 3 by which turn) sweep back to the other side at 20° a second firing each from its muzzle (lists 2, 3)
//!     every eighth frame (staggered by four): a tracer 0x0a72 at 24 a second along the muzzle's row, jittered 0.1
//!     ([`spawn_tracer`]); its sound 3. Both through, 6.
//!   * **9** (sub 4): it hovers (no code runs in its state).
//!   * **0xc** the laser (sub 5): every 90 ticks a laser 0x09df from its side's joint (lists 5 / 6 by turns), moving at
//!     first across its frame at the rank's speed (`$gp+0x2000`: 5.5, 7, 8 a second) and down to 159 over 60 ticks,
//!     then toward Ratchet ([`spawn_beam`]); its wait (330) out, 6.
//!   * **0xd** the hit (sub 6): its sequence 8, at its end 0xa (sub 4) heading for an odd stop, its speed 0.
//!   * **0xa** (sub 4): the rockets to fire (`0x31cda8`: by rank 2..3, 3..5, 4..6); sequence 4, at its end 0xb.
//!   * **0xb** the rockets: sequence 6; at its frame 2 a rocket 0x0b1b from joint list 4 along its facing (18 a second,
//!     flat), its sound 4; the rockets fired, 6.
//!   * **0xe** dying (sub 1): stopped where it is, rolling to 15°; every 45 ticks a blast (crate::moby::blast, size 1)
//!     at a random point of its frame and its sound 2; its bob quickens; after 180 ticks the big explosion
//!     (crate::moby::classes::explosion) facing the camera and it falls (0xf, the path dropped, −5/60 a tick).
//!   * **0xf** the fall: a blast every 15 ticks (no flash), it rolls to 45° and pitches to 90°, falling faster; 1 under
//!     its home its bolts (`0x31c188(m, 0, 3)`); 12 under: its camera tweak let go, `[0xa4]` let go, the music `[0xb4]`
//!     / `[0xb8]`, the pilot deleted, `0x1395c3` marked, **its mission done** (`0x3146c0`), its loop stopped, gone.
//! * [`tail`]: its flash; [`glide`] (`0x3f71b0`); its camera ([`camera`], `0x3f7b28`); the rotor and the turrets
//!   ([`turn_parts`], `0x3f7c50`); the crates back ([`crates_back`], `0x3f7d88`); the pilot ([`pilot`], `0x3f7798`);
//!   from sub 2 the boss bar (`0x2fddb0(health / most, 5, 0)`: picture 5); its draws ([`draw`]: the tracers'
//!   `0x3f7f88` with any kept, the rotor's glow `0x3f81e8` drawn last frame); its ticks.
//!
//! **The laser** 0x09df ([`update_beam`], [`draw_beam`]): its line hits as it sweeps, throwing sparks ([`sparks`],
//! `0x3d25d0`) at the hit and down the line; drawn as four glows and two pulsing strips straight down from it.
//!
//! **The guns' aim**: the turrets' turns are manipulators on the boss's joint lists 0 and 1 (`turn_parts`), drawn by the
//! engine on the placed moby; the muzzles' frames (`0x313b40` → `0x3189c0`, the joints posed with the moby's `+0x54`
//! manipulator list) carry them, as the port's joint queries now do.
//!
//! **Its end**: the bolts, the music, `0x1395c3`, the mission (the level's mission end, crate::game::GameState::
//! mission_done). No scene, item or skill point of its own.
//!
//! **Dev**: `RC_ENDAKO_BOSS=1` puts Ratchet at the fight's cuboid `[0x94]` on the boss's first tick (so the fight starts
//! at once) and logs its state changes on stdout.
//!
//! Not ported:
//! * The hero word `0x18a03e` (0xf0) of its taunt, the line's start held for its stream (`0x330128`: the port's
//!   dialogue starts at once; the pilot's sequence 1 starts with the line).
//! * A laser carried by a moby (`+0x40`: the boss gives none).
