//! Maktar's arena bosses (L02, the arena's chunk 1): pooled with the fighters in the master's group `+0x40` (state 1,
//! hidden, no updates: mode | 3) until the master sends one ([`send_wave_bosses`], `0x3fcb40`: its master `+0xb8`, its
//! start, counted in the master's `+0xa0` / `+0xa4`, the master's boss `+0xd0` the HUD's bar reads: health `+0x20` over
//! `(s16) +0x24`). In a wave with both, they fight in turns: the one out hands over (state 3) each time its health falls
//! under the next third (`0x3d5fc8` / `0x3dceb8`, the thirds counted in `+0x31a` / `+0x282`), and tells the other to
//! come out (`0x3d5ef8` / `0x3dcde8`, [`call_back`]); the master's boss and the announcer's line follow (`0x3fd5c0`).
//!
//! **0x09f8** (`0x3d4348`; senses `0x3d5870`, tail `0x3d5c20`, start `0x3d5d18`, back to the pool `0x3d5e68`): a hover
//! robot with two arms that each throw a chain (the links 0x0a19..0x0a1d, `+0x2a0..`). Its sub-state is the ground (1:
//! the reaction block makes a hit state 8) or the air (2: 0x12). Out of its pen (`$gp+0x1190`) it dodges (10, one of
//! the sequences 5..8: [`dodge`]), flies in (2) and lands near the middle (0x14). On the ground (6) it walks to its
//! target and within 9 facing him swings both arms (7, the blades from its joints 0 and 1 along their first rows,
//! 5.3 long); after a swing or a knock (8), a while without hurting Ratchet takes it up (0x13) to hover (0xb) at 13 from
//! him: within 5..40 it lunges to the height its chain reaches him from (`0x3d6810`) and throws a chain from either arm
//! (0xc..0x11, [`chain`]: the links run out and back along the arm, the end blasts and hits where it meets the floor).
//! Its time in the air over, it lands (0x14; knocked down in the air it lands stunned: 8 sub 3). Dead, its bolts, a
//! second, then the fade (crate::moby::classes::death_fade) back to the pool. In challenge 12 it takes no hits
//! (`+0x330`). It draws its eyes and, flying, its thrusters' glows ([`draw_09f8`]).
//!
//! **0x0a44** (`0x3d9188`; senses `0x3da708`, its move by its sequence `0x3dac90`, its turret `0x3db3d0`, tail
//! `0x3dab70`, start `0x3dc878`, back to the pool `0x3dcc40`): a walker carrying the placed turret 0x0a4b (`+0x244`, at
//! its joint 0, turning to the target on its own: `+0x248` / `+0x24c`) and its gun 0x0a4c (`+0x260`, made at the start,
//! at the turret's joint 4). It jumps out of its pen (2; `$gp+0x13c0`) to the middle, walks at its target (5; turning
//! with its sequence 2 in place), and every 600..1200 ticks spins (6: sequence 7, its legs hitting what they sweep,
//! drifting toward its target, its spin faster as its health falls) until the count runs out again; a hurt Ratchet
//! takes it to its taunt (7) and back to the spin. While walking (or spinning under a fifth of its health) the turret
//! fires two shots (0x0d08, [`spawn_shot`]) every 20..60 ticks within 45. A hit of more than 3 while it spins
//! staggers the turret (9); its health out (10), the turret's death sequence, then (0xb) its gun thrown, its bolts, three
//! seconds, five blasts and its pieces and the turret's thrown, back to the pool. Hits only count from state 5 on.
//! It draws the turret's lights (`0x3dc2d0`, [`draw_0a44`]) in a colour that fades between its states' and pulses.
//!
//! **The shot 0x0d08** (`0x423038`, made by `0x422ec8`): 40 a second for 150 ticks; a line along its step meeting the
//! world or a moby other than its owner: its sound 0, sparks (`0x423578`) and a sphere of 0.8 there hitting for its
//! damage (flags 0x810001); its last 16 ticks it shrinks with a sparkle every third; its time out, a burst of sparkles.
//! It draws a glow and five sparks between its two spinning points ([`draw_shot`]).
//!
//! Not ported: the skill points (`0x1a7a69`, `0x1a7a7b`: the level's sound 1 and the message 0x1233), the bosses'
//! damage tallies by weapon for the weapons' XP (`0x1ff6b8` / `0x1ff798`, `0x1b3770` / `0x1b3774`, `0x1ba644`), the
//! scale manipulators (`0x316598`: 0x09f8's hand balls hidden while a chain is out, 0x0a44's turret joint 4 growing and
//! shrinking as it dies), 0x0a44's arm aims (rotation manipulators on the turret's joints 2 and 3, `0x321bf0` /
//! `0x322f28`), the joint aim `0x32c1d0`, the chain's lightning (`0x3d7258` → `0x33db10`), the particle bursts
//! `0x345d88` (0x09f8's thrusters `0x3d74b8`, 0x0a44's landing dust `0x3dcf48` and stagger smoke `0x3dc768`), 0x09f8's
