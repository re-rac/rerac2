//! (sub 1); in sub 3 the charge first. 4 the knock (the framework's flight, facing the target with health): dead, its

//! the weapon kind 10, or the patrol, or the stand 0xc (sub 1, `+0x270` 580..600). 5 riding: on the beast with its

//! **States**: 2 / 3 thrown off (sequence end: dead → its bolts and fade; else collision back, mode | 0x5000, 0xc sub

//! with the wander (`0x345c78` = crate::moby::classes::leaper::wander), 10 standing; the timer 120..700 again. 5
//! the chat: its moby's facing turns its head (`+0x328`, ±90°, the joint aims are not ported); the sequences 0x1a..
//! 0x1e passed between the two (`+0x564` 1 ↔ 2; 3 picks a 1 of its group). 6 the look (the attack flag; at its end

//! end: 9; 0xf's: 0x10). 9 at its end (the calm limits): two of its group alive or more, a chat (0xb, then 5). 0xb
//! facing its moby (5° → 5). 0xc standing, turning to the target (`0x33d5a8` = crate::moby::ai::turn_to 0.001 /
//! 0.01 / 0.1, range over 0.2), at its sequence's end the walk home 0xd (home the path to go's first point). 0xd the
//! walk limits toward home; within 2: 0xe (stands), or 0x10 with the path. 0x10 at its sequence's end along the path
//! from its nearer end (0xf). 0x11 the swing: facing the target, at its end the attack flag and within 12 the strafe
//! 0x12 (sequence 0x14) else the walk 0x13 (sub 3); with the charge 0x15 (sub 2). 0x12 the strafe: turning to it;
//! over 12 a tenth of the time 0x13; within 2.5 the lunge 0x17; a third of its sequence ends a new swing (0x11, sub
//! 3). 0x13 the walk: toward the target (`0x34fbb0` = crate::moby::ai::move_toward, its yaw offset; with the network
//! [`net_walk`], `0x452500`, there: 0x12); within 8 the strafe. 0x14 the close walk (the walk limits): within 2.5
//! facing the target within 20° the lunge; within 2.5 facing it; over 9 a quarter of the time the charge 0x15. 0x15
//! the charge: within 5 with over 1 health the close walk (0x14, sequence 0x16, the attack flag); within 2.5 the
//! lunge / facing; else toward it (with the network [`net_walk`]). 0x16 the run along its path (stop 1.5, accel
//! 1/240; within 2.5 of the target the lunge, accel 1/1200, its path gone): at the end the charge or the attack. 0x17
//! the lunge (sequence 0xe: frames 10..15 two hit spheres of 0.4 at 0.5 and 1.5 ahead of joint 2, its damage, flags
//! 0x4000001; under frame 10 at 0.65 speed): at its end 0x18 (sequence 0x1f), out of sub 2 the strafe. 0x18 at its
//! end the charge.
//!
//! **The tail** (`0x4527c8`): the flash, the timers `+0x270` / `+0x272` / `+0x26` down, its ticks; a height change
//! under 0.005 this tick undone.
//!
//! Its first attack from calm sets the game flag byte `0x139646` (crate::game::GameState::flags `[0x8e]`).
//!
//! Not ported: the joint aims (`0x346548` / `0x349928` on `+0x2c0`: the head's look); state 0x15's lead hand-off (it compares the same distance twice, so it never happens); the creates' out of
