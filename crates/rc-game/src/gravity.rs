//! The gravity frames (G-LVL-003): R&C2's gravity spheres — places where "down" is toward (or away from) a point
//! instead of world −z, so Ratchet walks round a small world. One global flag (`0x1a8ff0` = `$gp − 0x6000`) turns
//! them on; Ratchet's frame mode (`0x18c0e3`) and his gravity direction (`0x18a0e0`) follow from it each tick, and
//! about 110 readers across the engine test it (Ratchet's physics, his camera, the shadows' probes, the AI, the
//! aims, the shards, the particles).
//!
//! **The data.** The block at `0x1a8ff0`: `+0` on, `+4` the cylinder mode (gravity across a vertical axis through
//! `0x1a9000`, heights measured as 100 − the distance from it), `+0x10` the cylinder's axis point. The sphere's
//! centre is in Ratchet's block at `0x189ed0` (its w `0x189edc` > 0: down toward the centre, else away from it);
//! the heights (`0x326820`, L02 `0x32ad88`) are distances from a second copy, `0x1b1a90` (L02 `0x1b3210`).
//!
//! **The writers.** The level load (`0x3012a0`) clears the flag and sets it from the level settings (their word
//! after the death height, with the centre `0x1b1a90` after it); Maktar's upper area (class 0x0b25, L02 `0x3f6820`,
//! crate::moby::classes::maktar::update_0b25) sets both centres to (500, 200, 500) and turns the flag on when
//! Ratchet rises past z 420 within 150 of it, off when he drops back below 420 (or rises past it farther away). Nothing of Maktar's world lies there (no collision
//! or tfrag of the level or its chunks within 150 of the centre; the arena, the only world above z 420, is 400 away), so
//! in its play the frames never turn on; the dev pin `RC_GRAVITY_AT=x,y,z` (crate `rc-engine` play.rs) tries them.
//!
//! **Ratchet's frame** (`0x2b37e8` → `0x2d37a0`): mode 2 while the sphere is on (not the cylinder). In a frame
//! mode his Euler angles (`0x189eb0`) carry a pitch and roll, the rows `0x189e20` (and their transpose `0x189e60`)
//! are his local frame, and the helpers `0x2d3860` … `0x2d4248` (crate::hero::physics, crate::hero::frame) do
//! their world-z work along his local up instead; his ground probe looks along the last tick's down, and the
//! post-move (`0x2c3330` → `0x2b9488` → `0x2b92c8` / `0x2b9008`) springs his up toward −down.
//!
//! Ported: the flag, the sphere's centres, [`Gravity::height`] (`0x326820`), [`Gravity::up_at`] (`0x326448` /
//! L02 `0x3864f0` without the magnetic walkway), Ratchet's mode 2 and down, the hero helpers' frame branches, his
//! camera's up (`0x2d9760`) and its frame branches (`0x421dc8`, `0x4227b8`, `0x4239d0`), the shadow probes'
//! frame branch (`0x31da58`, `0x2a97d8`).
//!
//! The level settings' sphere ([`Gravity::from_settings`]) is set at Ratchet's spawns (the Jamming Array has one).
//!
//! Not ported: the cylinder mode (`0x1a8ff4`, `0x1a9000`, `0x3263d0`; no consumer yet), Ratchet's frame mode 1 (the
//! magnetic walkways with the Gravity Boots `0x18a168`, the states 0x3b / 0x6d / 0x6e and `0x18a038`: their own smoothed normal `0x18a110` / `0x18a11c`), the
//! other readers (listed in docs/plan/gaps.md G-LVL-003).
