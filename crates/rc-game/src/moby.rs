//! Going Commando's mobys: the record (L00, 0x100 bytes per moby), `InitMobyInstance` `0x311418`, `CreateMoby`
//! `0x311320`, the level loader's static spawn (in `0x3012a0`), the active-list builder `0x313718`, the per-frame loop
//! `0x32e398` and the matrix rebuild `0x313dc0`. Native `f32` (docs/plan/decisions.md "native-first"); the record
//! fields keep their L00 offsets in the docs. R&C2's moby system is R&C1's (crate::moby::runtime,
//! rerac:rc_game::moby_update::scheduler) with the record reordered and 240 class slots (R&C1 224); each step here is read
//! from R&C2's code (docs/plan/bringup.md §6.6).
//!
//! **Record** (the fields the port keeps):
//!
//! | Off | Field | Off | Field |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | 0x00 | bounding sphere, ×1024 world (the rebuild) | 0x10 | position |
//! | 0x20 | state (≥ 0x80 deleted, 0xfe free, 0xff end) | 0x21 | group (−1 none) |
//! | 0x22 | class slot | 0x23 | alpha (0x80) |
//! | 0x24 | class header | 0x28 | next in the run list |
//! | 0x2c | scale (class 0x24 × instance) | 0x30 / 0x31 | update distance / drawn last frame |
//! | 0x32 | draw distance | 0x34 | mode bits ([`mode`]) |
//! | 0x64 | update function | 0x68 | pvars (0x80 bytes per created moby) |
//! | 0x98 | collision blob (class 0x10) | 0x9c | collision disable word |
//! | 0xa4..0xa7 | grid rectangle `{x0, y0, x1, y1}` (`0x80807f7f` none) | 0xaa | o_class |
//! | 0xac | `index << 16 | rebuild count` (the pose-cache key) | 0xb0 / 0xb1 / 0xb2 | mission, sub-index, uid |
//! | 0xc0..0xe0 | rotation rows | 0xf0 | Euler angles |
//!
//! **Class slots.** `InitMobyInstance` reads the slot of an o_class from `0x1da7e0[o_class]` and, when
//! `0x1da600[slot]` names that class, the update function `0x1da240[slot]` and the class header `0x1d9e80[slot]`.
//! The loader's slot assignment is not mapped yet; the port gives the level's classes slots in core-index order
//! ([`MobyWorld::new`]). The slot only orders the run list.
//!
//! **Not ported yet:** the spawn conditions of the static spawn (missions, the save's bits `0x19b2e8` / `0x19b4a8`,
//! the bolt / XP tallies `0x1c5400` / `0x1c54c0`), the pvar pointer fixups (kept relative), the ground snap of
//! rooted instances, the lights and colours (`0x3132e0`), the
//! animation advance `0x313420` (the engine animates every placed moby itself), the deletion and the created mobys'
//! pvar pool.
