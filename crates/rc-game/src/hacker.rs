//! The Hacker's puzzle: the game's mode 7 as the hacking panels (crate::moby::classes::hacker_panel, 0x0b29) open it,
//! ported from Endako's copy (L03 `0x3e37c0..0x3e5c90`; the same unit on levels 3, 11, 12, 14, 17, 19 and 20). The
//! panel names itself the mode's moby and makes the board, a sphere moby **0x0b28** (`0x3e6680`), whose update
//! `0x3e37c0` the panel runs while the mode lasts ([`tick`]); the game's mode 7 runs nothing else (crate docs of
//! crate::moby::classes::electrolyzer).
//!
//! **The board.** 14 nodes on a unit sphere (`0x29bc70`, normalized at the start: the cube's 6 face centres and 8
//! corners, node 0 the top face's centre), each joined to the nodes within 60° of it (a corner to those within 95°:
//! `dot` above 0.5, or −0.1 from a corner; the table `0x24a7b0`, 6 slots, −1 for none). The panel's list (its pvars
//! `+0xc..`, 14 at most, −1 ends it: `0x29bd50`, the count `$gp+0x1b20`) gives the path's length and, step by step,
//! its kind; its seed `+0x44` seeds the game's random stream (`srand`), so a panel's path is always the same.
//! * The path (`0x3e3f78`): node 0, then two corners of the top face side by side (one of four pairs), then nodes
//!   put in between two path nodes side by side (from a random place on: the first free node joined to both), until
//!   the list's length (or no node fits: the length is cut there). Its last node is joined to node 0: the path is a
//!   loop, and the board is solved back at node 0.
//! * The false turns (`0x3e4218`, [`Board::decoys`]): at each step, by its kind, 1: one node joined to the step's
//!   node, off the path so far; 2: a chain of two (the second joined to the first); 3: two side by side from the
//!   step's node (`0x3e43a8`: a random first slot of six, the next free one).
//!
//! **Play** (`0x3e37c0`). The sphere turns so the node Ratchet is on faces the camera, its first neighbour upward on
//! screen kept per depth (`0x3e4628`, [`Board::orient`]), eased there (`0x3e4c88`). The left stick picks among the
//! ways on (`0x3e4e10`: within 90° of the stick on screen): the path's next node, the step's false turns
//! (`0x3e4d60`) or back the way he came; a pick moves there (`0x3e44d8`) and starts the clock. Every new depth adds
//! `+0x4c` ticks to the clock (at most the start `+0x48` + 120). With the clock out, the board winds back to the
//! start node by node and the clock is reset. Back at node 0 with the whole loop walked: solved (sound 5), two
//! seconds on, the panel told (`0x3e6828`), the mode left (`0x32de20`). △ leaves at any time (solved if it was).
//!
//! **Its draw** (`0x3e5010`, registered each tick): the walked trail as arcs over the sphere (FX 14, `0x3e5758`:
//! 0.475 out, a ribbon 0.03 wide, a segment each 5°, its texture scrolling at 1.5 a second, a spark zig-zagging
//! along it), the ways on as short green arcs 20° out toward the node; on the screen the frame's GUI sprites 0xcb /
//! 0xcc, the clock's bar (25..38 across, up to 286 high, flashing), the depth in `n` boxes (473..487 across) and four
//! labels in font 2 ([`draw_hud`]). The board's glow pulses by the clock (`0x3e5b98`).
//!
//! The mode's view (the panel, state 5 / 6): the camera at the world's origin facing +x (`0x1b9980` zeroed,
//! `0x1b9bb0` the identity) with the field of view 0x3f8fea69 (crate::moby::classes::electrolyzer::tan), the board
//! 1.2 in front of it (`0x3e66f0`) — [`HackerState::view`] for the engine.
//!
//! Not ported: the sound's pitch by the depth on a move (`0x3621e8(h, depth/n · 1024 + 0x400)`: the port's sounds have
//! no pitch control), the owner check of the clock's ticking loop (the slot's moby `0x1886e8`), the help voice line
//! on level 11 (`0x2f6270(0xa43, 0x9a)` at the board's start, once in 1081 ticks: no help voice in the port) and its
//! word `0x18d090` on the way out, the word `0x1b2768` = 1 each tick, the PAL offsets of the labels (`0x1b3280`) and
//! the screen's y scale (`0x1b3284`: 1 here), the half-pixel offset of the boxes (`0x2fd380`'s −0x10 against the GUI's −8),
//! the reads past the end of the tables when a false turn has no node (a chain's second from −1 reads before
//! `0x24a7b0`; here none).
