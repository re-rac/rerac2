//! The body switch (`0x18c0d4` ≠ 0): the player's control moved onto another moby — Clank's body (1) on Endako —
//! and back to Ratchet (L03 `0x2b8508` / `0x2b8718`, the same code on every level that has a body; Giant Clank (2) on
//! the orbit levels, L22 `0x2b7200`: his capsule 5.25 / 4.45 / 3.75 and his health `0x18b694` = 1200,
//! crate::hero::giant).
//!
//! **`0x2b8508(body, state, moby)`**: a use of the hand item over (`0x2b5208`), the wrench asked for (`0x18c0d6`), the
//! items' last update (`0x2b7a20`), Ratchet's moby (`0x18aa38`) and his items hidden (`0x2d3d88`), his looping sounds
//! stopped (`0x2acf78`), his posture's records reset (`0x2abc28`); then the body (`0x18c0d4`) and its moby (`0x18aa34`,
//! the hero moby `0x18c0b0` from now on: the hero's animation, write-back and draw are its; mode |= 6, out of the moby
//! loop), the capsule's sizes for the body (`0x2b8f18`: Clank 0.6 high from 0.45 up, 0.3 round; the top and the
//! bottom at once), the animation speed 1 (`0x18aa40`), the state kept (`0x18c312`), Clank's health swapped in
//! (`0x18c2f4` keeps Ratchet's, `0x18c2f0` Clank's — 4 at the level start, `0x2ab1a8` — at most 4), and the state set
//! (`0x2c7288(state, 2)`).
//!
//! **`0x2b8718`**: Clank's health kept and Ratchet's back, the posture reset, the body 0, the body moby back in the
//! moby loop (mode &= ~6), his looping sounds stopped, Ratchet's moby the hero moby again where the player is (the
//! hero's position), the animation speed 1, and idle (`0x2c7288(0, 1)`) unless he is in the scene state 0x61 during a
//! scene (`0x1a8f00` 2 or 6).
//!
//! The moby side (the hero moby, Ratchet's moby and items hidden and shown, the hero's animation moved onto the body's
//! class) is the engine's ([`Change`], `rc_engine`'s play); the hero side is here. While a body plays, the hero tick
//! is `0x2a65d8`: no ledge probe but Clank's, no rail or pole, no item pass (`0x2b21f0`) and no pose layers
//! (`0x2afc38`): [`body_pass`] delivers the body's own hits (Clank's punch) in its place.
//!
//! Clank's GUI slot 3 callbacks (`0x2f8c00(0x23, …)`, his command ring) are crate::hero::commands.
//!
//! Not ported: the item records `0x18b700` / `0x18b850` (`0x3253d0`), Ratchet's moby's `+0x9c`, the
//! words `0x18aa44` / `0x18aa60` / `0x18aa68` (`0x2d33d8`), the body's light (`0x31bcac`), Clank's mobys
//! `0x18b680` / `0x18b684` deleted at the return (none made: G-HERO-004), the use's idle sequence of `0x2b5208`.
