//! (`0x41d510` → `0x41d838`, `0x41e138` → `0x41e480`: its update does not call the count yet); the debug code entry (`0x358550`). The reward flag `0x1a903c` (L01 `0x1a907c`) and its hint
//! (`0x2b22d0`: the vendor and armour hints 0x1b90 / 0x1b91 / 0x1b93 after a reward, by the count and the planet, 300
//! ticks apart). The pause's Skill Points and Cheats pages read the bytes and the count: crate::menus::special.
