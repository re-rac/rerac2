//! Type 0x4e: a swirl (`0x33d968` / `0x33daf8`; the Sheepinator's beam, crate::moby::classes::sheepinator): a twinkle
//! that flies its velocity and, near the moby it follows, circles it and closes in.
//!
//! **Made** ([`swirl`], `0x33d968(size, end, at, life, rgba, rot, spin, vel, moby)`): ALPHA 0x48, near 4 / far 32
//! (`+0x09` 0x24), frame `*def[0x4e]`, at `at`, `rgba`, from `end`·210000 to `size`·210000 (`+0x24` / `+0x20`) as a
//! twinkle swells (crate::particles::twinkle), its roll by `rot` (0: 0, 1: 0x20, else random) turning `spin` a tick,
//! `vel` (`+0x2c`), the moby it follows (`+0x38`) and that moby's aim height (`+0x3c`, read by nothing).
//!
//! **Each tick** ([`update`], `0x33daf8`): it turns; over its first 6 ticks it grows from its end size halfway to its
//! full size while its alpha halves, then on to the full size as the alpha runs out with the life; it moves its
//! velocity and rides the level's moving frame (`0x380e08`, crate::gravity::ride). With a moby to follow whose place is at most 2 ahead
//! of it in x and in y (the differences as they are, not their sizes): it steps 0.2 across (gravity × the way to the
//! moby) and its velocity turns to the moby — kept its speed while more than 0.5 off in x or y, else 0.03 — and rises
//! 0.02. Its life out: gone.
