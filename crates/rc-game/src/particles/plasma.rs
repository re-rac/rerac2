//! The upgraded Mini-Turret's plasma shots' smoke (type 0x6e, `0x342740` / `0x342988`; crate::moby::classes::turret).
//!
//! **A puff** (`0x342740(size, shot, at, alpha mode, life lo, life hi)`): ALPHA `alpha mode`, far 4 (`+0x09` 0x44), a
//! random roll, frame `*def[0x6e]`, `lo..hi` ticks, size `size`·630000, at `at` jittered ±0.015 on each axis, rising
//! 0.01..0.015 a tick along the up, its alpha 0x50..200 (`+0x30`), a grey of 0x60..0x80 (`+0x34`). Each tick
//! (`0x342988`): by `t` its life's share left, its alpha the start's · `t` and its colour from black toward its grey by
//! `t / 2`; its roll on a step; it grows 0.004..0.012 · 210000; it moves, its velocity ×0.99; both ride the level's
//! moving frame (`0x380e08` / `0x380ec0`, crate::gravity::ride / ride_dir); its life out: gone. The up is the frames'
//! (`0x37ecc0`, crate::gravity::up: the caller's).
